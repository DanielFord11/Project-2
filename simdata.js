I experienced several changes after this event. I also saw a small hovercraft at another time soon afterwards. I beleive it was of US Military in type. It hovered over a small pine wood ridge in the forest. Later in life I witnessed with another person, a group of triangular lighted crafts at night time and had an experience with a \"man in black\". The crafts were located over Shea's Monument in Mass. I am not using \"Word\" and I am only sending this due to future events that will occur before the end of this year. Do not contact me except in person if you need to. My family does not know so I do not want phone calls, emails or other intrusive communications.

     "text":"Golden orb follows car, then changes into black triangle ufo, stops , and \"waits\" for them to pass close by. It was New Years day, 1998. Approximately 10:55 pm in Wisconsin, USA.  Three people were driving from Milwaukee to West Allis on a routine 20 minute drive to drop off a companion on a cold New Year's night. While on the apex of a bridge adjacent to an industrial area, the back passenger spotted a golden light, flashing at a rate of about 4 flashes per second, moderately high in the dark southwestern sky [see FIGURE 1]. It was about the size and color of a small, golden street light, fixed in the sky behind and to the left of the vehicle. The back-seat passenger alerted the driver and the front passenger to the peculiarity of the light, and they all thought it might be some sort of \"helicopter\" or \"star\". As there was hardly any traffic, the driver slowed the vehicle down between 10 to 15 mph.  The object conspicuously glided down towards the ground and closer to the observers. It ceased flashing and became a solid \"gold-light orb\" [see FIGURE 2]. Now seeming to be only a few blocks away to their left (west), it began to parallel the movement of the vehicle‚Äîkeeping up with its exact speed.. It was fairly low to the ground because it was somewhat being obscured by some thin tree branches (without leaves) along the roadside.  The vehicle, now having passed off the bridge, continued to move northbound towards a major intersection. As the driver slowed even more to get into the left-hand turn lane at a stop light, a red light rotated around the left side of the object, and then a blue light rotated around to the right side of the object. Both lights stopped at the visible edges and remained fixed at the object's respective sides for only a moment‚Äîdisappearing within seconds [see FIGURE 3]. At this point the object was moving at its slowest. Because of the sudden appearance of the ‚Äúpolice‚Äù lights and its speed, the witnesses concluded that it must be a police helicopter on a mission.  As the car sat at a complete stop in the left-hand turn lane, there were a few cars to the right of the vehicle. But people in those cars were not looking toward the object, which was traveling at a laborious pace very low to the ground (perhaps a 100 ft). It could barely be seen unless you were looking for it. As the object began to cross over the avenue they were going to turn onto (west), it now appeared to ‚Äúbranch out‚Äù into a string of five pale-white lights. It moved silently, almost at ‚Äúwalking speed‚Äù. The witnesses rationalized that it might be some sort of plane trying to make an emergency landing - but why land perpendicular to the street?  The lights suddenly stopped and became fixated directly above an estimated seven story factory building just two blocks away. The traffic light changed to green, and the driver finally turned left toward the object; it was just up ahead. No other cars or people were out on this usually busy street. Curiosity and perplexity filled the witnesses as they moved closer to the building.  Finally, the car pulled over to the side of the road. The back passenger rolled down his window and stuck his head out of the car to observe what could be resting in the sky above. The other two people strained to get a good view from the front passenger window. What seemed like a string of lights from a few blocks away on approach were actually the lights on the \"front\" and underneath of a large, black, equilateral triangle object. The five lights shown down like \"baseball stadium lights\", and were located at all three corners and in the middle of the two \"front\" sides [see FIGURE 4].  This large object was ‚Äúfixed‚Äù in the air, producing absolutely no noise, movement, or flashing. Everything around them seemed so still, almost like they were in a vacuum and ‚Äúweren‚Äôt supposed to be there.‚Äù The body of the triangle was colored charcoal-black, with a faint, grayish grove running along the front tip to the back center. There were visible sides: the edges showing a continuous grayish-black indentation with a slight overhang or lip. There also seemed to be very faint ‚Äúcircuit board‚Äù type etches on the body of the object. These apparent etchings were more apparent in the center grove on the ‚Äúbelly‚Äù of the triangle and within the groove or indentation along the sides. One witness later remarked that some of its features reminded him of a ‚ÄúStar Destroyer‚Äù space vehicle from the Star Wars movies.  After approximately 30 seconds of viewing the object, the driver became agitated and fearful, saying that they ‚Äúhave to get out of here.‚Äù He drove away and continued westbound on the avenue. When they left, the object left their point of view. But as they increased their distance at a block away, it came into view again in the back window, still fixated in the sky in the exact position last seen. Anyone else viewing the object might have passed and though nothing of it. It was so still and innocuous, that they probably would have thought it was part on the building complex. As the car passed over a hill a few blocks west of the object, it could not be seen any more. No other cars were observed on the road until about a half mile later.  The total experience was less than 5 minutes.  The three witnesses remained shaken for the rest of the night, with one of them insisting that it must be some sort of police helicopter performing a maneuver, and never wanting to talk about it again.  The most disturbing thing to the witness in the back seat was that even though he had been a big ‚ÄúUFO buff‚Äù from the time he was young, the word ‚ÄúUFO‚Äù or ‚Äúalien‚Äù never entered his mind until after the triangle was completely out of view. He even had other UFO related experiences before this, but still cannot explain why he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfreaking out‚Äù at the time. The best explanation was that ‚Äúhe was denying it in his mind to keep his body from freaking out.‚Äù  The strangest element to the whole experience was the apparent personal awareness the object had to the witnesses. It got their attention by flashing, moved in and followed alongside the vehicle at a distance, changed forms, and seemed to wait for them and them only. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))",

Looking southeast out my window before going to bed, it was totally black outside. This was quite unusual.(I live in a rural area and always see a few house lights, snow on the mountains, and occasional car headlights in the distance.) In the upper left corner of my window I saw a large luminescent lime green rectangular object with rounded corners. In the 2-3 seconds I saw it, it did not appear to be moving. There was no glow, trail, aura or beams from this object going to the ground or sky. All the luminescence and color were contained in the rectangle. Inside the rectangle there appeared to be other colors of perhaps yellow-green or silver-white that I can only say reminded me of plumbing pipe shapes. There appeared to be movement of the light within these shapes.  All of this happened within a few seconds and as I thought \"what in the world is this?\", before the whole sentence was formed in my mind, the rectangle light flickered out, as if a switch had been turned off. It was still completely black outside my window. I went outside within five seconds. All looked \"normal\". No airplanes, satellites, barking dogs - nothing to indicate anything out of the ordinary had just happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

While looking through photos that were taken by my webcam, during the day of 03/18/07 I came across 46 clear frames containing an unknown black object (1 object)  in the sky. There were actually about another 16 or so frames that I didn‚Äôt use because the webcam I use is wireless and subject to interference and these frames weren‚Äôt centered correctly or had many interference lines in them. The total amount of frames was about 64.  Each frame is 30 second between shots. The ufo would have had to be in view for 32 minutes. The camera is aimed at the eastern sky and the photos are sent to my website at http://aboutfacts.net .  The black object slowly moved from west to east at an upward angle until it was too far east for the camera to see since a wall blocked the view.  I don‚Äôt know the exact time the photos were taken,  since they are not time stamped, but by their placement I can assume it was somewhere between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm.  The object looked almost like a completely black cloud, but it was the deepest black you would ever see, an unnatural black. As it moved across the field of vision it changed its shape. I am including photos of it from my webcam and a gif animation I made from the 46 clear frames.  My Background: I am retired and the webmaster of http://aboutfacts.net.

     "text":"two interrelated objects larger rectangle and rotating cube on one end changes shape, speed direction gas filled Subject: a couple of first hand incidents plus a family information exchange    First hand incident number 1  Spring 2005 husband and I were riding our bicycles on the access road of Interstate 35 between Wonder World Drive and McCarty Lane (we lived on McCarty Lane at the time) outside of San Marcos, Texas.  It was approximately early afternoon and the wind was really blowing very hard.  We were approaching Auto Outlet (a car dealership).  It was common practice for the car dealership to have balloons (this month I seem to recall single purple and yellow helium filled balloons) tied to the front posts and lot lighting fixtures.  Due to the velocity of the wind the balloons were straining against their ties and leaning towards the Auto Outlet buildings and away from I-35 in the direction of the wind.  I was right at the northernmost corner of the Auto Outlet property and my husband was approximately 4 bike lengths ahead of me (he is a faster stronger rider in a hard wind or just about anytime).  We were on the western side of I -35 on this access road.  We were on our way home from a pleasant ride that day.  The Auto Outlet property has a bill board, or it did then, on the McCarty side of the lot where south bond drivers on I-35 can read about their car dealership.  This bill board is about a standard large bill board size that businesses pay for ad space so highway driver's can read the signs.  My husband and I look above the roof line of the Auto Outlet buildings and observed a very strange sight.  There was a rectangular, 3 D object floating slowly straight up above the buildings.  Next to that object was a 3 dimensional square cube object.  This object changed over time in appearance and navigational mode so I'll do my best to try to explain what I observed.  The larger object was the rectangular object.  From what I observed the side closest to me, the bottom, the back end and  the front end were a purple grey type of material that had no seam lines.  The object appeared to be filled with gas and the fabric covering the shell without seam lines did not undulate but kept a rigid straight line appearance on all edges and sides that I could observe while lifting slowly up at first.  On the end closest to the billboard side of the building there was a short distance to the cube, and there were no connecting ropes, guy lines etc.  The cube was rotating on a 360 degree pattern, always remaining at the same end of the rectangle.  The cube rotated that 360 degrees at a faster rotation rate than the lift rate of the two objects together.  The cube straight up lift rate was the same as the purple grey rectangle.   The cube appeared to have a purple bottom and alternating purple grey on one side, red on line side and yellow on one side and black on one side of the cube accounting for a 4 sided cube.  The cube like the rectangle had no seam lines, appeared to be of some kind of fabric, without seams, and kept the edges and sides perfectly straight and rigid there was no undulation in the fabric like a cloth baloon would be expected to have.  Also surprising there was no visible frame structure such as internal piping retaining the outer edges of either the cube or the rectangle.  As the objects continued to slowly rise, I noticed as did my husband, that if these objects were filled with a bouyant gas, it sure did not move away from I-35 as the Auto Outlet yellow and purple lot balloons did.  The objects did not respond to the very gusy wind that day in terms of speed and direction.  The objects were going straight up slowly as though no wind were present at all!!  It was so gusty it was hard to ride the bikes sideways to the wind.  The winds slowed our speed.  It took a lot more effort to pedal against this kind of wind and move.  It was very surprising to my husband and myself that no one on I-35 tried to pull over on the shoulder and stop and look at these two objects.  It was as though they did not see the objects as unusual or they had no frame of reference with which to relate to the objects. The objects did not make any sound at all as they moved. After the objects got above the height of the \"along the access road power lines\", they changed configuration.  The purple grey rectangle shifted somehow as on an invisible axis and moved from horizontal view to an up-ended view and as it did so the cube moved with it, still rotating as it did so in relationship to the very same end of the rectangle.   The cube ended up above the straight ended up rectangle and continued its rotation at all times.  Remember please, there were no guys, no ropes, no attachments between the cube, the space between and the end of the rectangle. Once up-ended in a vertical arrangement, the purple grey fabric of the rectangle began to undulate like a catepillar's segmented body trying to move up a leave blowing in the wind.  Pockets of gas started to undulate upwards inside the rectangle towards the top end of the object.  As more gas was moving upwards, gas from below leaving the lower portion, caused the object to lose the rigid rectangular shape from the original lift, sinking in in that region and narrowing the formerly rectangular lower end section.  The top section closest to the cube was rounded now and the fabric was bulging out from the increased gas pockets inside.    The overall structure looked like it was climbing up not just floating up.  All this while the cube kept its perfect cube shape and continued rotating without attachment on the same end of the other object it always stayed in configuration with. This continued until the object was quite small and as high up as the air space normally traveled by a stunt plane pre-jet.  At that height, it appeared to resume the shape originally seen during the lift and turned the cube end west ward.  Originally the cube end was facing the south.  With the cube facing west I could only see the bottom of the purple rectangle and the back end of the original purple grey rectangular larger object.  At this point, the objects took off at a vastly increased speed, while not as fast as a jet air plane it was noticeably faster than any derrigle I have ever observed.  The rate was possibly faster than a private beechcraft plane going approximately 120 miles an hour or more.  My brother owns one and I have flown as a passenger in his plane before. I have never seen anything move like this before, constructed like this before, change shape like this before, and my husband and I do not believe the objects were man made. We do believe it was some kind of  surveying unit or probe for close observation of the environment.  Something like a mobile environmental collector. The area is close to the Balcones fault line, the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone, Canyon Lake area.  So there are geographic anomalies close by.  San Marcos River is entirely spring fed from the Aquifer. Close in calendar time, we read an article about the US Government considering budgeting funds for high flying spy derribles.  However, this was before that project was funded because the news story stated lobbying was going on to obtain support for a bill in Congress to fund the spy derrigibles.  Such spy derrigibles were to be extremely high altitude units. The objects we saw flew close to the ground and in normal air space.  They simply moved as nothing else ever observed and were constructed in a unique way out of unique materials. It would appear from when we first saw the rectangular 3 D with rotating cube on one end that it had just lifted up from the lot behind the Auto Outlet and we had arrived at the frontage access road just as the slowly rising object topped over the top of the buildings.  We did not take pictures.  I do not know if my husband would consent to talking about this to anyone for fear of derision.  I want to protect my anonymity because I am a licensed state professional. Second first hand account  My husband and I were driving into Austin Texas on I-35 and observed two grey apparently gas filled tubular shapes, the length of a standard pick up truck undulating in movement floating very close to the ground but never touching the ground, down I-35 next to a concrete divider wall (units for use while road construction is in progress), between Onion Creek and Town Lake.  We both were amazed.   The objects paced our vehicle perfectly, we were going about 65 mph because traffic was heavey in broad day light.  The objects were directly in front of us and over to the driver's side closest to the concrete divider.  Then we watched in total amazement as one object went straight throught the concrete divider having turned with the movement of an eel towards the  concrete divider it had been traveling next to.  The other object  undulated sideways and up and over the top of the concrete divider unit and down the other side.  Both left our view at that point.  We both agreed they did not appear man made, had no seams.  These two units were grey gas filled like tubes that undulated like eels and/or worms,  were longer than a man is tall, and seemed to make decisional changes in direction and speed. They also appeared translucent, which the tow objects described in first hand account were definately not translucent at any time that we observed.  It was almost as if the grey tubes were life forms.  No eyes, no mouths, etc.   The skin on these two objects did not look like any kind of fabric but rather like a membrane.  The closest thing I can think of is imagine a picture of a cell under a microscope without the internal elements and cilia. We did not take pictures.  No camera on hand at the time.  I am not sure that my husband would agree to talk to anyone and I am a licensed state professional. Family related experience  My California Aunt and Uncle (Uncle is now deceased) had a home on private land that adjoined the Tahoe National Forest.  This couple owns more than one home.  They had a hill top home with a sliding glass door and outside deck overlooking a forested valley towards Tahoe National Forest.  They get so many grazing acre rights inside the forest for having land adjoining the forest.  This is why they located there or so my mother has told me.  One night they were both sleeping with the curtains open where they could see out through their sliding glass doors as they feel asleep.  At the same moment they awoke to see a blinding white light fill their bedroom and the space outside the sliding glass door.  As if mesmerized they felt drawn to go outside on the deck to try to discern the shape of the object and make out what it was.  The object they told me later was huge and appeared to be round due to the light.  They never could see the defined edges of the object because the brightness of the light never diminished enough to make out the actual edges.  The object made no sound and drifted or floated towards the valley floor below them.  After a while it appeared to land and the lights went out.  When the lights went out, because they were out in the country there were no surrounding lights to reveal the ship.  In the morning they got up determined to attempt to travel to a road closest to where the ship landed and to hike on foot to try to find the landing sight and see if the ship was still there.  They wanted to know what was going on where the ship had landed.  When they got approximately where they would have to pull over on the shoulder of the road and hike to the site, they saw a man that looked exactly normal from a distance.  They drove right up to him, stopped and got out to speak to him.  The man was dress in a white shirt, white pants, white belt, white socks, white shoes, all in white.  His hair was soft and his face was unlined.  The man was normal height and had black hair, black eyes with undiscernable pupils from the color portion of the eyes, fair skin like a caucasian and normal looking features.  However the air there felt charged and something about this man did not feel right to my aunt and uncle.  At this time my aunt and uncle  were in their mid fifties.  The man appeared no older than his thirties.  He was lean and fit.   They asked this man if he had seen the bright light in the sky last night and if he was there looking for what had landed.  They asked him where his car was.  The man was in the middle of no where so to speak and there were no other people around, no animals in view, no bicycles in view, no motorized vehicles of any kind save my aunt and uncles car.  They asked him if he needed assistance or a ride somewhere. The man at first listened to their questions but said nothing.  When my aunt and uncle fell silent and stopped asking questions the man looked at them like he really meant business and told them that it would be in their best interest not to try to find the landing site, not to hike in the woods that day, not to stay in the area and that they should leave the area immediately.  They left feeling not at all comfortable with the situation.  Having driving less than a car length away my uncle said he stopped the car to look back towards the man to see if he had failed to observe anything else important.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  There was a distance of at least 100 feet or more between the road and the tree line of the forest and nothing man made or geologic for the man to hide behind.  The man had simply disappeared from view.  They said they never saw anything like this before or after this experience.  They told me they were certain the ship was a UFO and the man was not a human born on this planet. My aunt and uncle did not give me permission to release this information but they told it to me first hand.  They did not take any pictures.

     "text":"Black rectangle further details I almost fell out of my chair when I read the possible explanation for my black rectangle sighting of Nov 9, 2006.  Still, I appreciate the open and questioning nature of the NUFORC website, and I‚Äôd like to respond. First of all, I am well aware of the planes towing the banners.  Usually they are for the \"12 Oaks\" Townhouses.  It couldn‚Äôt be more obvious that a small plane is towing a white banner with clearly legible type.  Not by any stretch of the imagination is this remotely a possibility for what I saw.  Neither was it a billboard or a streetlight or a street sign. It was a smoky matte black rectangle, close enough so that I could see it was quite large, in the same way that you can quickly tell if a nearby airplane is a child‚Äôs toy, a small plane like the ones that tow the banners, or a large jumbo jet.  This rectangle was clearly a jumbo.  And it was hanging in the air, moving slowly or possibly not at all when I first sighted it.  It was electrifying to see it, and in one second I ruled out all the usual suspects- a sign, a light, and yes, I even briefly considered a banner as a possibility.  But this was obviously an independent floating or flying craft of some kind, with no supporting poles or strings attached. I got a very clear and long look at the rectangle in a large open area, above the horizon, with no obscuring foliage, as I continued down the raised highway.  It was one of those things I‚Äôll remember crystal clearly for the rest of my life.  At this point it was evident that yes, the craft was moving, albeit relatively slowly, much slower than even a small airplane would move.  And the edges were distinct and crisp, although there was an unusual, almost ominous tone to the black color.  It was sort of unearthly, actually, a smoky matte black, as I stated earlier.  I felt that it was metallic.  I believe I was looking at a side panel or back panel or front panel of the craft.  At the time, I thought that the rest of the ship was hidden by perspective, but now I tend to think it was camouflaged with the exception of this one panel, for whatever reason. My great regret is that I didn‚Äôt stop the car and flag down other motorists to be witnesses.  I thought of doing it, but it would have been very dangerous in the rush-hour traffic with a narrow shoulder, with me not wanting to take my eyes off this incredible ship in the sky.  I‚Äôm glad I was able to keep looking at it, though, because as I was watching it in this wide-open area it just faded away, or \"cloaked out,\" before my eyes, as if it realized it was being watched.  Briefly, I could see a diffuse rectangular shape well camouflaged against the blue sky, sort of like a rectangular panel of water hanging in the air might look like from a distance.  The ship definitely disappeared from \"cloaking,\" as opposed to traveling too quickly to observe.  Absolutely amazing. Since then, I‚Äôve researched these types of sightings quite a bit.  The shape I saw is very much like the shape I‚Äôve seen witnesses draw of the sides of \"black triangles\" or similar craft.  Some people believe these are secret American military craft- perhaps a \"stealth blimp\"- but I find that very hard to believe.  Reports of these types of sightings go back over half a century, and have become quite common the last decade or so.  These ships, usually seen in heavily populated areas, are sometimes seen to move at incredible, apparently instantaneous-type speeds.  I saw one fade from view right before my eyes.  If we‚Äôve had these ships for half a century, which in itself is ludicrous, we‚Äôd have been using them in battle for quite some time now.  I‚Äôve seen a Stealth Bomber flying up close, and as awesome as the Stealth Bomber was, I have to say that the black \"rectangle\" was a lot more amazing.  An advertising banner?  Absolutely not!",

We were almost back to our dorm and was stopped at a stop sign. There wasn't hardly any traffic.  My friend and I was amazed. It was huge! Black metallic rectangular shaped. It was close, hovered, and soundless.  We were speechless.  In addition, my car actually died and did not start until the craft was out of site.  When it moved, it rotated.  I was thankful my friend saw it with me or else I would have questioned my sanity.  Before I saw it, I did not believe in the possibility and was strongly against the existance of such things. However, ever since, I am very interested in the possibility of UFOs and possibility of other intelligent life forms.   I am glad that I saw this.  Even though many didn't believe us, we KNOW what we saw and experienced. I will never forget and could draw a picture of it even now...almost 30 years later.",

     "text":"Bright round red light followed by a sequence of bright orange rectangular lights at tree top level. On April 9th, at 9:20 pm. I saw a bright red light come on then go out. Then four bright orange lights lit up from left to right, then went out one by one from left to right. Then 5 orange lights lit up from left to right and went out one by one from left to right. These lights were really bright. The red one was round, but the orange ones were shaped like rectangles. They were right over the tops of the trees in my neighbors back yard directly behind us in the northeast, within 5-600 ft. from me. The orange ones had sort of a screen look to them. Like they were windows from a craft. They were lighting up as though they were going around something circular. The very next week they were back and my husband and I both saw them plus, we heard that two other people about 4-5 miles from us saw the same thing. On the 16th of April, the same thing happened. The red light showed up first. It was followed by bright orange lights (as bright as tail-lights on a new car). This sighting lasted about an hour. The orange lights looked different than the ones I saw by myself the week before, though. These looked more like flares, or fireballs, but they didn't go anywhere. Not up, not down, just around something like a disk shaped object that we couldn't see. They again came on left to right and went out left to right. It was like a sequence of a different amount of lights coming on each time. One set was three, one set was 9-12, one set was 2, etc.  Then, as though another craft was answering the first one, (this set of lights was straight east instead of northeast) Four bright yellow lights lit up. These lights were bigger than the orange ones, and that is the only time they lit up. Then the orange ones in the north east went RIGHT to LEFT, as though they were satisfied with the answer of the other craft. That was the end of the sequences. We got video of the bright yellow lights, and two of the last four orange lights as they were going out. The next week (April 23)I got a video of a craft going over with no sound, and a smaller light came out of the craft. These had no sound, even though it was directly over my head. There was no flashing lights to indicate that it was an airplane of some sort. The smaller light that came out of the bottom of the craft, came down and then went west as the larger object was flying north to south. Then there was another smaller light flying east to west over the larger object. My husband is a truck driver with a high school diploma, and I am a registered nurse/truck driver, with over three and a half years of college, plus more college credits from the internet. We are reasonable, christian people who never expected a UFO to show up in our back yard! This is currently being investigated by another UFO reporting agency However, I can give a copy of the video to another investigator.",

It was completely dark. Save for 1 VERY bright light. It was flashing red and blue, so I got my brother and a friend to check it out. They confirmed. It was NOT a plane. Excited, I went to get a pair of binoculars from my truck. I stood up on my wall and focused in on the object. I saw a round shape with a curved bottom. But on top there was a bright green light just shooting off. On the sides, there were red and blue lights flashing. For about 10 minutes, it slowly dipped toward the mountain. Then, to my amazement, it split! There were now 2 small white lights about a finger width apart (from the distance away). They sank lower still. Suddenly, they shook violently for a second, then shot back together, again to form the previous object. I was shaking, almost unable to hold on to the binoculars. I gathered myself and watched it. It was close to going over the mountain now. But, before it went behind the mountain, it suddenly just shut off. As if a light switch had disconnected the circuit leading to it. I focused more, and faintly saw the outline against the stars in the back. It descended into the dark mountain. I though it was over. Now the most shocking part. As I continued watching, I saw a black circle shoot down from the sky at a very high speed, with a thin white tail-Right where the UFO had gone down. I almost dropped the binoculars again, but managed to get them to my eyes to see ONE MORE black circle shoot towards the area. The area behind the mountain lit up dramatically and then quickly died down. We checked out the are from a hill. There were flashing red and blue lights, surrounded by little lights all around. Slowly, over the course of an hour. They all died out. Save one. It descended further down the mountain, until we could no longer see it in the darkness of the trees.",

It was stationary so we thought it WAS a  police helicopter. Then it dawned on us that our police dept most likely doesn‚Äôt  own that many helicopters! They had flashing lights but were not flashing lights on the ground like police helicopters do when they are looking for someone etc. They just hovered ther and were very bright.

We live in the city, at the end of a street  near a hospital ,with helicopters landing and taking off many times of the day and night, so we know what they look and sound like day and night.  We are also very familiar with the airports traffic patterns and what several airplanes coming in towards the airport on the horizon look like.  This was not like that. These objects hovered like helicopters had flashing lights of red gold and white all at the same altitude over the distance of about 10 miles altogether. As we drove down the road, (about 8-10 miles or so, we saw all of the lights remain where they were, but began to notice in between them were VERY small objects (tiny red lights) that travelled at very high speeds  between the brighter larger main objects. We stopped the car and witnessed several of these small objects travelling very fast in different directions.   Our son became worried because we were shocked and very interested to the point that we stopped the car, so we continued on to the grocery store and went inside.",

The t.v. was turned down low so I did not wake the family up. I just happened to look out the window and I saw the object fly north west.The lights were spinning around the object.

I have been in the aircraft business for over 25 years, first in the Marine Corps then in the civil world. I am a pilot and I have been around all kinds of aircraft and helicopters. I live just south of a major airport ( DFW ) and I know what modern aircraft look like and I know all the flight patterns for the approach for DFW and the smaller airports in the area.  Sunday aprox 11:50 am My daughter 15, her friend 15 and myself where driving North bound on Robinson rd ( cross street polo dr ) when I noticed something that looked like a big black box high in the sky, aprox N>E>  over Dallas. This object was really high in the sky, above the approach that airliners take to DFW or Love field. At first I thought it must be the blimp ready for the Dallas game that day. Upon further inspection while we sat at a red light in my truck it defiantly was a big Black Box shaped thing? I couldn‚Äôt make out much detail but it seemed to have what I would call notches like a cube on it. At this time the light turned green and we drove due north, at this time my daughter saw a jetliner on approach to DFW and it was way below the alt of this thing. When we stopped again at the intersection of Robison rd and Westchester it was still there and the plane had traveled quite away and was disappearing from sight. AS we sat at the red light watching this thing it just disappeared?",

As I approached the ridge, the lights disappeared over it as if flying backward with headlights in front.  There were no other blinking lights such as red and green as on regular air craft, just the yellowish gold light. As the golden lights went over the ridge, one craft continued on as if to land at an airport further West such as Lancaster or Harrisburg.  It continued traveling West as I headed West.  The appearance of the object had changed from small aircraft shape to orb-shape sometimes appearing to rotate end over end.   The color changed from yellow/gold to bright white with bright white beams of light protruding from the orb.  There were also bursts of red and green colors emitting from the circumferce of the orb (as seen through a lousy pair of binoculars).  Family member came outside to investigate the object as it continued to hover in the Western sky from my house.  A half hour later, object seemed further away than before, but still hovering and emitting the three colors of light.  Last night was cloud covered so the object wasn't visible.",

I suddenly saw this huge bright object and I knew it was not a planet,  coming from the north and as it got closer, I could tell it was a rectangular shape as it had multicolored lights all around it and one solid green light underneath.  All of a sudden it stopped and a few seconds later probably 10, a second object which looked to be like the same as the other one pulled up beside it and there was a red beam of light, looking like a laser but much wider projected to the first object for another 20 to 30 seconds and then it retracted. About 20 more seconds the first object started moving south and then made a quick left and accelerated at a fast speed going east and then it just disappeared. The second object still hovering so to speak, rose upwards, turned and headed back in a north direction from where it came and also suddenly disappeared. This was very strange indeed and I never saw anything like it before and I still wonder just what was that red laser beam of light was and if they were transferring something or repairing something.  Both objects were, I perceive to be of a vast size.  I can't believe, no one else did not see these things.  I do not drink or do drugs and my mind was clear as a bell!.  However, now my mind is pondering on what I saw. Thank you for your time in listening to my sighting of two objects which I do believe were not of this world, but I suppose it could be anyone's guess or speculation.",

While following a jet far away, I saw this rectangular shoe-box shape object come into view as I was moving the binoculars. I watched it for a few minutes in total amazement. What is unusual is it was completely motionless, and it was camouflaged the exact shade of color as the blue sky. I was about to yell at my neighbor to come look, but when I looked thru my binoculars again I could no longer see it. It vanished very quickly. I tried for several minutes to find it, but could not. It seemed very far away, which means it must have been pretty large. I looked at it without the binoculars and all I could see was a tiny blue dot. I wish I would have had a telescope with a camera on it to take its picture. What is my opinion? I believe it has an electrochromatic polymer surface to camouflage it the same color as its background. I believe it is a creation of the military-industrial complex, (and it could be foreign-made, as in Russia.) As for the ability of this non-aerodynamic craft to hover motionless, and then fly away at high speed, I suspect scalar wave technology is in effect.

At 11:35 PM I walked my two daughters to their cars outside my house after a party and we stood talking for a few minutes while Rachel got in her car.  Rachel, age 30, saw a very large shooting star to the West, then a brightly lit \"cloud\" above the same area to the West of our location at approximately 60 degrees from the horizon.  She pointed to the cloud and followed it heading North.  The full moon was out, the cloud ceiling was low and it was windy.  The scattered clouds were moving very fast. It was easy to see the sky, stars, moon, and clouds. At that point, at approximately 11:40 PM, Maria and I both saw a large black round disk-shaped object that appeared to be on it side (top or bottom facing us).  The size was larger than a dessert plate held at arm's length. It was moving slowly from Southeast to Northwest along the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and moving slower than the clouds, which were clipping along at a fast pace. It was very windy.  The full moon shone brightly and I assume that is the only reason we could see the object.  There were no visible lights on the object. Maria, age 32, saw this at the same time I did, but Rachel did not, even though she was looking in the same area.  After a few seconds, the object changed to a gray color, then just vanished.   I then said outloud  \"We want to see evidence of any persons not of this world\" and all of us looked in the same direction where the black object had been and I was pointing.  Right after I said this a shooting star appeared in that same spot.  Then we saw lots of shooting stars all around the sky (probably a meteor shower).  Rachel left for home. Maria got in her Suburban to leave, but I noticed a bunch of tiny twinkling lights above the center of the hood of her vehicle appear for 2 seconds, then they disappeared.  I was looking at this area trying to figure out what the lights were when I noticed a reflection of a rectangular light that came on then blinked off on her hood.  Maria got out of the car and the light appeared again.  I soon figured out that it was blinking on and off every 25 seconds, so we knew it had to be something mechanical.  Being square was odd, though.  So she turned off her car and I turned off all the lights in and outside the house in order to see if we could identify the source of the light.  It continued to blink on and off, being an amber color, white, or blue at different times.  There were two spots close together where the lights appeared.  We could not locate the source. We tried blocking the lights out with our hands, and checked the trees moving in the wind that might be blocking or unblocking lights.  The one light continued to blink off and on at regular intervals of 25 seconds. The only reflection of light on the hood that we could identify was the moon, which was in a different location from the blinking lights.  Then I realized something and said \"OMG\" - and Maria finished my sentence with \"It's something we can't see and it's above us.\"  I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which I had charged up the night before and it went dead after 3 seconds.  Maria got her Sony digital camera out of the car and video-taped and took photos of the car and in the sky above us. Note: The photos came out very dark and smudgy. I got the night vision monocular out but could see nothing.  I then saw a tiny orb appear inside Maria's vehicle, then disappear.  I fully expected to see a ship hoovering right above us!  We could feel the presence of something. Then, 45 minutes after starting, the lights stopped at approximately 12:35 AM.  Since this date, strange things have been happening around my house and my psychic abiliti! es have improved, almost to the point of being annoying.  I see a golden glow around all living things, and this is rather distracting.  Also see details in energy fields around humans.  Received a vision on the morning of Dec 25 with symbols I did not recognize but later found out that they are the Mayan numbering system. There is more, but I don't have room to put it all down here.",

     "text":"Brilliant white \"square\" stationary in the sky above west Orange County / Lake County Florida. On 15 August 2008, from approximately 6:25pm to 6:30pm, I observed an unusual object in the sky while I was driving home from work.  I had just merged onto SR429 from the Florida Turnpike, heading north toward Apopka, Florida.  The weather was partly cloudy, but it was not raining, and visibility was good.  Looking out my driver‚Äôs side window (toward the west), something in the sky caught my attention. An incredibly bright, white object appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky at what I would estimate to be 700ft to 800ft in altitude.  My initial reaction was that the object was probably an airplane reflecting sunlight while banking, but after continuing to observe it, I quickly realized that was not the case. The object appeared to be perfectly square in shape, not a cube, but a flat, square shape.  It was smooth, with very clearly defined perimeter lines and corners, and was a very brilliant color of white;  incredibly bright, but in a different manner than the brightness of the sun (very comfortable to look at, no glare associated with it, and its brightness did not obscure its shape at all; there was no  \"halo\" or other glow surrounding it in spite of its brightness).  It seemed to be illuminated from inside of the object, even though the object was so flat that it appeared to be almost two dimensional.  The object was located well below the cloud cover, and stuck out like a sore thumb against the overcast, grey sky. I would estimate my distance from the object to be at least one mile.  I‚Äôm not sure I can accurately estimate the size of the object, but my impression was that it was fairly large given that I could clearly see the outline of its shape at that distance.  The best description I can give regarding its size is that if you held your thumb up at arm‚Äôs length, the object would appear to be slightly smaller than your thumbnail. The object was absolutely stationary in the sky; no movement whatsoever for the entire period that I observed it (at least 5 minutes).  While observing the object, I noticed a small, round flashing light that appeared to be further west of the object, but moving toward it.  When the flashing light had almost reached the bright, square object, they both disappeared.  I spent several minutes trying to spot them again, but they never reappeared.",

     "text":"Helicopter-like ship light belt I live in Manhattan , New York city, and would like to report the strange thing that happened tonight at about 4AM . I was watching a movie, when a strong noise, like that of a helicopter, appeared all of a sudden over my building (very close to Washington Square)  I went out to the balcony and saw a big object standing still, flying very close to the last floor (the 17th, I live in the 3rd)  Actualy I would have said it was a helicopter, but my mind was saying to me \"no, it isn't\", as there was a wierd light belt surrounding the structure from the bottom to the top, with white, blue and red colors.  I went downstairs to follow the object, as it was disappearing to my eyes whenever it crossed to the other side of the building or was geting closer to the roof.  As you can imagine, I wouldn't have gone downstairs a regular monday at 4AM for something that wasn't wierd enough.  I have to add also that, as a sciencetist I use to be kind of objective and sceptic.  I took my camera (regular old digital camera) with me, but the only one picture I could make was a very vague light in a dark sky, which equals nothing.  The object finally slowly flew towards the west side, I tried to follow it, but disapeared between the buildings. I went from 3rd street/Laguardia Place  all the way to the 7th avenue, and from there I could just slightly hear the \"helicopter\" noise, but couldn't see anything else. I want to imagine that it was a helicopter that, because was dark and the long shaped structure, I was confusing with something else, and that's all. But could you please let me know if you have been reported from anyone else or you can find anything like this today?

     "text":"Saw a greyish black stretched cube with rounded corners with bright white windows on it UFO Sighting by my Cousin My cousin is a nine year old male.  He lives in the northeast US.  He claimed to have seen a UFO on two occasions near his home. Incident #1 Date:  Actual date isn‚Äôt exact though he remembers somewhere in mid January 2009. Time of day: approximately 7PM Location: My cousin was out in the yard playing with his 2 dogs, a golden retriever and a chocolate lab.  He claims that the dogs actually spotted (or heard? or sensed?) the UFO before he did which drew his attention to it.   He spotted a UFO hovering just below the tree line that was shaped like a ‚Äústretched cube‚Äù (rectangular block shaped) ‚Äì the trees were approx 80-90 ft tall (estimated).  My cousin estimated that the UFO was about 1000 ft away from himself.   The grayish-black (charcoal) colored UFO looked like a ‚Äúsquare house with rounded corners with lighted square windows all around it on every side except for the top and bottom which had smaller round white lights‚Äù.  The UFO then came above the tree line and started doing different flipping and turning movements.  He said it didn‚Äôt look like or act like a plane or a helicopter or anything that we know of or make in the US.  He described the pattern of bright white lights along the windows as going all solid and then flashing very quickly in an ordered sequence one after the other and then back to solid.  The lights on the top also flashed in the same pattern.  He claimed that after the craft went above the tree line that it was ‚Äúwatching him‚Äù and sort of ‚Äúshowing off‚Äù as it did its maneuvers.   He estimated the size of the craft as approximately 30-40 feet long and about 10 ft high.  He mentioned that it spun slowly 3 to 4 times on different axes (Y then X and then like a 45 (or 135) degree angled axis).  He noted that after spinning on one axis that it would very quickly move linearly to another position and then spin slowly on a different axis.  Both dogs were trying to get inside the house when the craft appeared.  They were barking and yipping to get inside the house and didn‚Äôt appear comfortable around the UFO.  This whole event lasted for about 3-4 minutes.  He didn‚Äôt hear any sound at all though because his dogs were barking loudly so that pretty much dominated any audio.  However he noted that he didn‚Äôt hear any loud jet-lane type noises.! He men tioned that while the UFO was in the tree line of pine trees that the branches were shaking and shuttering.  He only watched for 4 minutes and then went inside because it was unnerving.  And after inside the house he looked again quickly and it was gone.  He told his parents who didn‚Äôt believe him which is why I am penning this for him (Uncle Age 43) Incident #2 Then about 1.5 months later he claimed to have seen it again in the same spot though only for about 30 seconds this time.  The UFO appeared to execute the same maneuvers as described above in the first incident. He drew some pictures that depict the UFO and how it turned axially and also the lights on the side. My cousin gets good grades in school and isn‚Äôt lying about this.

I was out on the porch, standing on the top step,  the sky was very dark that night, and I was smoking a cigarette and talking to someone on the phone.  For whatever reason I looked up and saw this enourmous, silent object moving slowly over the house heading north.  The object was jet black and never seemed to end...it just kept coming and coming over the porch.  I could make out that it was rectangular in shape,flat,solid, silent and black, like a parking lot in the sky.  It was so enormous that I could not tell if it was 20 feet above the house or 200 feet or even more.  I was in such awe that it didn't occur to me to be scared.  I was describing it to the person I was on the phone with but they were saying that it had to be some large military plane or something, but I know it wasn't.  It's not the type of thing you run around telling people about because I couldn't even get the person on the phone to believe me as it was happening.  I saw what I saw and there is no explanation other than it being a ufo.  It slowly made it's way north, over farm land and other homes toward hwy. 99E at the town of the town of Canby.

Also at this point I relized it wasn't going foward or away.It wasn't a helicoptor. It was dead silence outside. Now I was curious, so I kept staring for roughly five minutes. I watched it go from one side to the other in the sky. Then it went up and down. When this bright orb would go from one side to another it would disapear for a sec then reapear to a different part of the sky. Don't know why I waited so long to say something to some one. Also the following week I saw military chopers in the sky. One cargo looking one and a tiny one. That following week I saw something in the day time - a black sphere speeding through sky. I have never see anything move that fast befoere. This isn't the first time I've seen things here in Vermont. I guess cause of the view I hav. It's over 100 miles and crystal clear skies.

     "text":"Mysterious black rectangular object in the North Charleston sky. Hi, I'm an area manager for a small chain of stores in Mt. Pleasant and Charleston County, SC.  Well yesterday, 11-1-09, I was driving home to North Charleston from one of our stores loacted in Mt. Pleasant.  I always take the 526 home to North Charleston.  It was just before sunset yesterday and as I was driving I saw the strangest thing in the sky.  It looked like a black rectangular object that wasn't moving, way up in the sky against the clouds.  I thought \"what the heck is that?\" and had to keep driving but I did slow down some.  There is no safe place to pull off the road once on the 526.  Well I kept watching it and watching it as I drove.  I believe I saw another craft of some sort up way, way above it and to the right of it and this smaller, harder to see craft may have been plane shaped.  I began to think things.  I thought that maybe there was a helicopter or plane towing something. But I really didn't see a tow chain or rope of any kind between the two, but that's what it looked like.  Now my immagination went wild and I want to say it reminded me of the Star Trek Enterprise pulling the borg cube with a tractor beam! Seriously, I thought well there must be a logical explanation.  I thought the airforce might have been doing some scientific experiment and may have dropped or pulled something from behind a plane or helicopter as a weather/wind experiment or something like that.  I thought well maybe one of those planes that pull an advertisement sign behind it like those I see off the beach when I go to Daytona. I just don't know anything.  Now I want to believe that it was a spaceship from outerspace with extraterrestrials on it.  I really, really do!  All I really know for sure however is that I saw something in the sky that didn't seem to be moving at first, like a black, rectangular window against the white clouds way high up that day.  Then I saw the other thing, the maybe plane shaped craft.  Now the black object either turned and narrowed, or as I drove foreward I saw from a different angle and it narrowed.  I believe they started to slowly move and eventually I lost sight of them because I entered into my own neighborhood and trees blocked any further view of them.   As soon as I got home yesterday I wrote to MUFON and a representative from MUFON called me last night.  Today I told my boss about the incident and I even tried to contact the Charleston Airforce base to ask if they had anything unusual or unexplained on their radar over North Charleston yesterday, but I cou! ldn't find an e-mail addy that would do any good.  I watched and looked at the thing for a good fifteen minutes on my way home on this 526.  There were plenty of other cars on the road and I'm surprised nobody else noticed, if they did, they didn't post a report about it.  Well I'm a definate believer.  I'm convinced!  I am not a skeptic.  I believe in UFOs and in extraterrestrial life.  I've seen too much not to be a believer.  I sure intend to keep on watching the sky!",

Kind of like a rubrics cube twisting. The object was changing colors but was over all very bright whiteish blue. Kind of like looking at a huge high def TV around 5000 feet. It was above the clouds. Didnt look like anything any of us had ever seen.  Someone inland fired up a spotlight and pointed it at the clouds below the object. The rectangular twisting light source continued a sort of accent untill it was a dot against the sky like a star. VERY STRANGE. Cant find any news and im getting frustrated because im sure lots of people saw it + someone pointed a searchlight at it. Hope to find others who witnessed this.",

The lights were bright white, and the aircraft seemed to be a rectangular shape. The object 'fell' in an arching motion, and then quickly changed direction and took off FAST, where it disappeared. The object left a 'check-mark' shaped light trail, and disappeared in the vicinity of where it appeared. The duration of the sighting was only about two to three seconds, but we are both positive of what we saw. We recently moved to the San Diego area from Hawaii so my girlfriend could attend graduate school at the university. We have never witnessed anything like this, and just want to know if anyone else witnessed the same event.",

     "text":"Craft shaped like a cube of bright swirling light, hovering over downtown Amarillo at 3:00 a.m., spot lights and heavenly music . . . After retiring to bed on a late Sunday evening in a cheap downtown motel room in Amarillo, watching television until I fall asleep, I tossed and turned until somewhere between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m., when suddenly a light flickered through the curtains.  I didn‚Äôt pay much attention as I thought it to be a neon sign on the Bank of America building across the street.  I rolled over and attempted to sleep when the light again flickered through the curtains.  I still ignored it, and again with even more intensity the light flickered through the curtains. I reluctantly got up and moved the curtains so I could see where the light was coming from.  I looked up at the top of the Bank of America building of about 20 stories high and the neon sign was not flickering.  I was closing the curtains when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter surrounded by bright lights. Spot lights were coming from the base and shining in various spots in the parking lot.  My first thought was that it was some kind of drug bust and the helicopter would be landing with a swat team.  However, the craft did not land, but stayed hovering high in the dark night.  Now it had definitely got my attention. As I focused on it, I made out the shape to be a cube, definitely three dimensional.  I couldn‚Äôt make out any substance such as steel.  It was a cube of light, swirling bright light on a three dimensional cube.  I was still trying to rationalize what it could be.  I then remembered seeing special shape hot air balloons in Albuquerque which lit up at night in similar fashion.  \"That‚Äôs what is must be,\" I told myself.  Then something even stranger happened.  I heard musical tones similar to wind chimes or ancient flutes that we often hear in Greek mythology type movies.  But the sounds were coming from inside my head even though it felt I was hearing them with my ears. I became afraid and did not move for about 20 minutes while I continued to watch.  I finally said to myself, \"What ever it is knows I am here, and I cannot hide from it.\"   I immediately dressed and walked outside.  I stayed underneath the 2nd floor overhang and peered out to see above.  It was even more magnificent when viewing through the night air although it was hard to focus on, somewhat blurred.  At that moment I was surrounded by an orchestra of musical tones again sounding like ancient flutes or pipes.  I thought to myself, how beautiful!  The song was child like, something you might hear a children‚Äôs nursery.  Again, I heard the music in my head and outside, but not in our natural way of hearing, hard to explain . . . To make a long story short, I packed my bags and was running to my SUV when an early morning garbage truck and driver stopped in the alley next to my car. I looked at the driver in the eyes and signaled to look up with my eyes.  I turned and ran with luggage in tow, got in my car and drove two hours to my home in Lubbock.  I drove to my sister‚Äôs office where my mother happened to be and told both of them what I witnessed.  By the look on their faces they were fearful for me.  I phoned a friend of mine who happens to be a deputy sheriff in Amarillo to ask if anyone had phoned in such a sighting in the early morning dark.  He laughed hysterically and said no, but would let me know if anyone did.  He did not call back.  I‚Äôve since moved to Phoenix and have told only a handful of people what I witnessed that early morning on June 20, 2005, five years ago.

I was looking North and I saw a small white light that I thought was a star move south towards us slowly; then, it speeded up and when it came about 1/2 mile north of the housing area the light broke up into three lights.  As they moved extremely fast within 10 seconds they were above us; they seemed to pause in midair with no sound.  The lights turned gold and there was no moon out that night. Then, the objects changed shape into golden flying angels.  Some of the neighbors said they looked like flying golden eagles from where they stood. Within the next second, the three objects flew at a southwest angle and disappeared completely into the dark night.  I ran in to call the police department and asked them to record it on their dispatcher log.  We talked with the neighbors for a few more minutes and I spent the night with my son and his family. i was spooked to return to my home which was 19 miles away. We couldn't even guess how fast the objects moved; it was an eerie feeling watching the objects change shape.  I will never be a skeptic of ufo stories.  There is something out there; I feel we are not alone.

Then a red light appeared on the end. It then turned into a cluster of round white lights. Then a red light appeared in it. The red light went away and a wide line appeared through the center of it. The line faded away and it remained a cluster of white lights. My daughters looked and it and said it looked like it was turning. When I looked at it again the lights went from bright white to a purple, then went out and we never saw it again.

     "text":"A V-shaped object in the night sky, no noise, could only be seen with binoculars I was visiting friends in Glendale, California just after the wildfires had begun to subside.  We thought we might be able to see them at night, I believe we heard there‚Äôd been another flare-up even though it‚Äôd been about a week or more since the really intense ones. So we were outside about 11p.m., standing on their quiet residential street when the 3 of us, me (57 years old), my friend (about 54), and his mother (about 86) saw a jewel-like thing shining in the northern sky, somewhere above Montrose.  It didn‚Äôt move, it was very small, didn‚Äôt glow or change colors (kind of clear, actually) but very noticeable. My friend went in to get binoculars to see if we could get a better look at it, and when he did, his mom and I looked away at stars and lost sight of it.  When he came out we could not find it, so they eventually went back in the house, but I decided to stay outside and just look at the beautiful California night sky. I‚Äôd occasionally put the binoculars up to my eyes, and since I wear glasses I had to keep adjusting them, not knowing whether to adjust them to my regular eyes without glasses or with my glasses on. I finally just left my glasses off and began looking up, straight up. Suddenly I saw a V-shaped object moving slowly southward. It did have smaller V shaped designs or window or something greenish colored, but not lighted, more of a glowing, I just followed it for a few seconds, maybe 5-10, then tried to look without binoculars.  But I saw nothing, even with my glasses on. When I put the binoculars back up to my eyes, I saw the same type of object except it wasn‚Äôt green, it was an ORANGE colored V-shaped object, also moving slowly southward.  I have no idea if it was the original object, or a second one, or what.  Again, no lights, more of a glowing of smaller V-shaped designs within the larger V-shaped object.  The point of the V led the object.  I could near nothing, nor see anything without the binoculars and have no idea how far up, or how big it was. I just guessed that it was some kind of military plane or something, I didn‚Äôt know UFO‚Äôs were ever reported to be V-shaped, until I saw something on TV last night (Oct 20, 2010) so I decided to report what I saw.",

We had planned to take a short trip across town to visit my mother that evening, and our only vehicle at the time was his motorcycle. As we mounted the bike in the driveway we looked up and in the distance saw three blinding white lights. They weren't far from the ground; two below and one above in a tight triangle configuration. My fiance was in the Air Force at the time and worked at Wright Paterson on the weekends. \"What the Hell is that?\" he wondered aloud. \"It's probably just highbeams on a crane\" I suggested. We would know soon enough since we had to head in that direction.  We drove for about a mile, all the while my ex was saying \"What the Hell is that??\" Eventually we came close enough to be able to tell that it was too high up to be lights attached to a crane, but they were dead still. Suddenly we noticed that a large rectangular space behind the lights was far darker than the sky around it. My ex yelled \"WHAT THE FUCK IS IT??!  Then slammed on his brakes as about six African American kids ranging in age from about ten to sixteen dashed in front of our bike. Their eyes were also fixed on the monstrous craft. And it was bloody huge. Not \"Independence day\" huge-but easily as large as a football field or larger. It was gunmetal gray; like a giant monolithic slab  about the proportions of a thick cereal box or box of cigarettes with slightly raised and depressed geometric shapes of various sizes on it's surface (it was not smooth at all). It hovered over a large empty parking lot that stretched out in front of an abandoned Rink's department stor! e. The road we were on was busy, but I didn't notice if others had stopped to look. The craft had the three painfully bright lights mounted on what looked like it's front. There were smaller amber/ red and bluish green lights underneath it that glowed steadily, and as we kept driving we came around to the \"back\" of the craft, which featured three (maybe four) flat, glowing rectangular panels in a horizontal row that were tilted slightly downward. They looked like large observation windows to me, and I felt-or perhaps even saw-figures moving around inside. I didn‚Äôt want to see anymore and looked down. My former fiance finally said \"We have to get closer!\" and I completely flipped out -and I'm not one who is given to \"flipping out\". He turned the bike toward the craft and I hit him hard and told him that there was no way in hell that he would take me any closer. I was in tears I was so frightened. Just as this was happening the group of boys that had crossed in front of us co! uld be seen running across the expanse of the parking lot towa! rd the a rea under the craft. As they neared it I glanced down for a second time, not wanting to see what was happening,  and as I did I heard my ex exclaim \"Holy Fuck!!\" I looked and the kids were standing there, but the craft had disappeared. Ken said that it had shot straight up into the sky at a speed that was simply unbelievable. I begged him to keep driving and we continued on.

It was a summer afternoon and my father and myself were washing our car's in the driveway.  The cloud cover was very sporadic or mostly clear blue skies.  I stopped washing the car to go get us something to drink in the house.  While walking up the path to the front door a silver glint caught the corner of my right eye, turning my head and looking up and to the right I saw what I had previously thought impossible.  In the distance at if I lifted my right arm from waist to object would be two o'clock I saw an absolutely enormous silver cube or box!   It looked to be a perfect rectangle and the sun reflected off it giving it a stainless steel appearance.  There seemed to be orange and red circular lights aglow on its surface and it rotated slowly clockwise and drifted further away and at great height until foliage completely blocked my view.   My father also saw it and was as stunned as I was to see a flying box that formed a perfect rectangle with no sign's of propuls! ion but what created even more awe was the sheer size of this object!  As far as it drifted away its size was still amazing!

We had three separate incidents on the same evening, which was Thursday, July 22, 2010. 1.  Sometime between 9 pm and 10 pm, my sister and I were sitting side by side on the second floor porch of our beach house looking towards the ocean when we saw one small reddish, slightly orange light appear out of nowhere.  It reminded in the sky for a few seconds, then disappeared; poof it was gone.  Brief seconds later it reappeared in the same place then suddenly become two and moved apart slightly, then disappeared: poof gone. Brief seconds later the single light reappeared and then quickly blinked out.  There was no sound.  They seemed very far away  The lights were not the same red as lights on airplanes or helicopters.  My sister is in her mid- 40's, very intelligent, very down to earth.  I was surprised when she said, \" I saw them too.\"   2.  Later, after 10 pm, my two sons (14 and 17) and my brother (early 40's) were sitting on the same 2nd floor porch looking towards the ocean.  My son (17) saw a large, saucer-ish shaped object, about the size of the moon only not the moon, not round, not white, but red on the outside, fading into bright yellow on the inside. It appeared out of nowhere. It slowly (but still in brief seconds) moved to the left and remained there for 2 seconds.  It slowly (but still in brief seconds) separated in 5 objects, reddish orange in color, saucer-ish shape.  but smaller than the original mass.  It was as though the large saucer-ish shaped light was covering the 5 smaller masses and it disappeared to uncover the 5 smaller things.  Then they disappeared from the outside in: they went from 5 to 3 to 1 to none.  My son (14) had the impression of a red light that \" looked sort of like fire\" that \" looked like it sort of came in\" and then \" went out.\"   My brother was not looking in the same direction and missed all of this because happened so quickly.  My sons both have good heads on their shoulders as far as I know.  My brother is ultra logical.  I was down stairs.  My sons came and got me and I went back up to the porch. 3.  Now my 2 sons and my brother and I are sitting on the 2nd floor porch (between 10:30pm and 11pm), raptly studying the sky over the ocean.  After about 30 min. suddenly a large (moon sized) saucer-ish object came out of absolutely nowhere.  It was the reddish, orange color. No sound. It seemed to have movement, as thought it was vibrating or something.  It was there for seconds and then POOF! it was gone.  We were all amazed. I have seen 2 maybe 3 things in the sky that I cannot explain during my life.  I'm 51.  I am open, but also try to be a critical thinker and question everything.  I would not mistake the moon or the planet Venus for an alien craft or a manmade craft!",

     "text":"7 spherical orange lights/UFO's w/ rectangular aura sighted in night sky at Redondo Beach, Ca.  10-8-11 at  23:58 At 23:58 on Saturday 10-8-11, I was smoking a cigar by the pool in my apartment complex when the security guard on duty came running by shouting to follow him quickly.  When we arrived at a clearing, we saw orange lights hovering in the sky, moving in very slow formation.  By the time I was able to get my cell phone to record the event, we counted 7 objects in the sky.  They seemed round and bright orange and seemed to dim out and disappear.  Duration was about 2 minutes. Two minutes later, at 00:00 10-9-11, we saw a single UFO moving toward us slowly. It was closer this time. The best description I can give is that it looked like a rectangular orange lantern floating in the sky even though we knew definitely that it wasn't a lantern. It was longer vertically and at the center was a brighter spherical light, perhaps the craft itself. The rectangular shape was more like a light surrounding the craft and not the craft itself. It soon dimmed out and with the naked eye we could still see, faintly, the spherical center moving across the sky. Almost like it turned the light off that gave it a rectangular aura. Then it disappeared. At 00:05 10-9-11, another single UFO appeared and seemed to float across the sky before dimming out again. Again orange and like a rectangular lantern with a brighter spherical core. There was never any sound. There was no wind, the night was relatively clear with low cloud in certain parts. When the singular craft moved toward us at 00:00, we could also make out a kind of reflection of white light behind it on the bottom of the cloud. Almost like if one would shine a headlight up toward the cloud. I have posted the videos I took from my Droid3 phone onto Youtube. The cell phone videos don't do justice to what we saw with our own eyes. But at least it was recorded! Here are the links for your review. I couldn't figure out a way to send it via email because the file sizes are too big. I work in sales/promotions at the Los Angeles Times and the security guard was an MP in the army during his tour in Iraq.

I looked up directly at it, It has a straight line/row of small color lights, directly down the center, In between the two big lights. It was no plane, It was no helicopter. I could not see a form or craft, Only the two big bright round lights then as I got very close, I seen the row of smaller color lights down the center, The color lights was from the front part of the bright white lights, towards the rear, And past the rear, About 5 or 6 smaller color lights.  The colors was red, I think orange, I dont know if there was more colors or not,  They lighted from front to back, slowly but consistant, On, Off one at a time. There was no sound that I could hear and the size of that should have had noise no doubt.  Anyway I guess it was a mile up or less, Very close, I looked away after about 15 seconds to dial my wifes cell phone and tell her to look up But as I told her and looked back at it, ! It was gone. completle no where to be seen, It was totally black sky again about 10:45 Pm.  My house was only about 1 mile from where I seen it. There was 2 or 3 cars back behind me, I noticed them after it vanished.  I wounder if they seen it too. This this was like I was ment to see it ?. I know that sounds crazy!.  I always believed in ufo's, Aliens with out a doubt, I just never ever seen anything like this.  This was some type of ufo: I guarantee that....was it military, Maybe but why there.....and If it was military,  Then They Made something out of this world. I am telling you this was no doubt in my mind a ufo: I am 39 years old and never seen nothing close to this.  I alway's believed, Now I Know.  Was this thing a actual space ship thing ? or A Monitor/Spy Thing ? .  What was it.... Why did I see it....????  WOW.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I stopped my car and sat there looking out the window trying to take a picture but my phone camera would not capture it because it was too dark and the object was too far. I immediately call my sister, who was still in the house right behind me, and she looked out the window and saw the same. She headed outside with my other little sister and our mother and they brought along a camera. I headed into town to my boyfriend‚Äôs house and I also told him and his dad what I had just seen and they headed out to the back yard and we looked towards the north and it was still there. We kept a lookout for about another 30 minutes and nothing was happening. So we headed back inside the house and about an hour after we first spotted the object my sister called and explained to us that a white light had hovered over the train shaped object and everything suddenly disappeared into nothing. I looked back onto the north and it was all darkness excluding a few street lights in the distance. The object was rectangular about a half a mile long divided into rectangular even length sections. It was all brightly lit in different dim looking colors not very bright some of which we can remember were white, red, green, blue and yellow.  Around this train shaped object were red dots hovering above and on the end of each side. There was no activity that we could see and there was no movement at all until after an hour around 8 that a white light came as if from behind the ‚Äútrain‚Äù and it all disappeared. As we looked back to where this had been it was dark as if nothing had been there at all.",

There were 3 red blinking lights wthin the grid as well. I slowed my car and thought possibly it was something new that the city had placed there for planes (?. I have lived in north Tucson for 18 years and have never seen these lights there before. The rectangular grid was almost the size of two football fields.

There was a police cruiser who drove by right under the biggest, blue object.  He drove very slowly and he had his headlights off.   After a couple of hours I went into bed, with them still out there and watched through the window as the porchlight pulsed, as if power surges and then dimmer.  I called my mom, I then called the police but rreported anonymously.  I dont think they took me seriously.   Before I went into bed we noticed a flat, black aircraft with a bright flashing red light on top racing around the sky very quickly under these objects as if to warn them that they had been noticed by our militery?   Also, planes began arriving from the east about every three minutes.   When we got up the next morning the sky was divided into perfect pie wedges made with com trails. as if to mark each objects location.  Some very odd things happened after we all got to bed.

As I stared for a few seconds, in the path of my focus was a black rectangle which was moving straight West. The object maintained a steady rotation. It never changed direction or speed as I could not take my eyes off of it.  I have 20/20 vision and I eyeballed that object until it was so far West, it was no longer visible. As I composed myself to keep it together, I looked up at the sky again and WOW! Another exact duplicate black rotating rectangular object following the direct path and speed consistency as the first. As high up as the two objects were, I would estimate about a mile high, they were approximately 15-20 feet in length and thin. Solid black and awesome.  I have only been fascinated by my lucid dreams of flying or having fun in the dreamworld prior to the two objects I witnessed. I am amazed at the thin blue lines before sleep that evolve into symmetric patterns only to be introduced to a diamond grid which is made apparent by the unseen force behind it. A presence or Some &quot;thing&quot; is swooshing cursive-like gleaming, sparkling, glowing, shimmering communication. Hard to believe is not my concern, I simply do not understand exactly.  I also have had a black triangle become apparent in my presleep light show. I am used to the star cluster normal activity when the eyelids are closed. But just a few days ago, I was messing around with concentration and the ultra violet or purple clusters opened up in the center and formed a black triangle. THEN, a star or spark appeared in the exact center. Wow, then I see those two black rectangles in the sky?? I have NEVER messed with acid or mushrooms. Been weird forever it seems.",

     "text":"A bright UFO jumps out of a wormhole/portal and possibly abducts a young man  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I believe in 2006 I was abducted by extraterrestrials in Clarksville,Tennessee in the early morning hours of early December around 3:30 or 4:30am. I was asleep in my room then awoke and felt like I immediately needed to get up and do something so I got up to go smoke a cigarette in my garage because it had been cold outside for the past two weeks but as I got closer to the garage door I heard a voice in my head say &quot;YOU NEED TO GO OUTSIDE&quot; So, I said speaking a pond what I had just heard&quot;YOUR RIGHT LET ME GO OUTSIDE&quot; so I turned around and went out my back door and as I stepped out the door I noticed that the sky was crystal clear it appeared as if every star in the sky was visible. As I looked to the left I saw what appeared to be something like a rainbow it was purple and pink and it sat right above a tall tree in my neighbor's back yard. It looked like a snakes body when it slithers but not going from West to East but from South to Nor! th above the tall tree and it also appeared as if it was transparent so I said to my self thinking what is that I've never seen that before. Then I looked off to the right of me still scanning the sky hoping I would see a UFO but I didn't so I turned back to look at the strange colors thinking I'm going to watch whatever this is to see if it disappears or fades away and as soon as my eyes locked on the strange colors a circular ball of light surrounded by a neon green and blue gas or plasma substance which stayed around the helicopter sized craft the entire time shot out at super sonic speed and made a complete stop the craft hovered for app 10 seconds and then started to move really really slow to the right of me for about 7 to 10 seconds before shooting off in super sonic speeds without making a sound and left behind 6 circles that look like smoke rings with lines in between each of them. As I turned my head the object appeared to be coming back in the opposite direction ! except this time it appeared to be far out with the stars and ! traveled out as far as I could see within 5 seconds so by this time i was crying like a baby because I couldn't believe what had just happen to me so I stepped up on my stairs to the house and looked up to the sky and asked &quot;GOD IF THAT WAS MEANT FOR ME AND IF YOU MEANT FOR ME TO SEE THAT WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW ME ANOTHER SIGN? And as soon as I said that a smaller circular ball of light flew right over my house lower than the UFO with noun of the same characteristic as the UFO except for how bright and illuminated they both were.  couldn't handle it any more so while still crying and in complete shock I went in my room and laid down and felt such a sense of peace that I had a smile on my face from ear to ear and it felt like I was dying and leaving my body then I blacked out within a minutes or less saying oh my GOD oh my GOD. Then I woke up around 10:30am the next morning looking around thinking OK I'm in my room and I jumped up thinking to my self oh my GOD that really did happen to me last night so while in the shower I felt a bump underneath my right arm pit and quickly got out the shower to look at whatever it was knowing that it hadn't been there the morning before or months before or years prior to the event that took place last night. The bump appeared to have a oval black burn mark in the center. The bump went down after two years but now you can clearly see a whole and what appears to be an object perfectly placed in the center where the black mark once was. It is still underneath my arm as ! of this day and it is going on 6 years now. It appeared as if I was burnt by a laser or injected with a hot needle at first but now it appears as if I was implanted with something that Dr Roger Leir studies but it has never caused me any discomfort. All I want is some help so I can understand what happen to me that night. This is my honest to GOD truth. I also have a picture of the mark that's underneath my arm and two picture's I took of a UFO on my birthday March 27 of 2009",

     "text":"9/22/2012 Saw around 20 objects that changed stages. Today‚Äôs Date: 9/24/2012  Date of sighting: 9/22/2012  Time: approximately 9:50pm  I was driving northbound on Frantz Rd. in Dublin Ohio and entered the left hand turning lane and stopped at the red light.  I was anticipating turning left, onto Metro Place North, and therefore looked to my left and noticed some red looking dots in the sky. I thought, ‚ÄòWow, those look kind of odd. Must be helicopters?‚Äô   I then heard a three ‚Äòthwump, thwump, thwumps‚Äô of a helicopter blade that sounded every bit military.  These sounds however came from my right.   I looked out my front windshield and up and over toward the direction of old downtown Dublin and saw no helicopter, nor heard nothing more of blades.  Looking back to my left these red dots were now close enough to have a visible shape. In this stage they were red and rectangular. Like the shape of a slightly shortened domino.   As the first one went by, the red color parted as a sliding glass door would at a department store.  This exposed a red translucent keg barrel shaped sphere. There was no red, only night sky all around this.  I noticed some black horizontals and a vertical line as it passed.  I went on to look at the others that opened in the same manner.  These however had orange translucent keg barrel shaped interiors.  The horizontal and the vertical lines appeared in shades of gray. The shades of orange would also vary.  As these passed more would stream in from the distance and follow in fashion continually moving eastward, and towards the end southeast and up. I would say 20 or so total over the course of a few minutes.  Dots, then rectangular, then opening, then closing, then moving on.  Two in particular came very close above the 10 or so story buildings.  They appeared to be maybe a 100 feet above the buildings.  I watched as these two orange keg barrel shaped things seemed to position themselves for something.  The one on the left stopped. It stayed stationary. The one on the right approached the one on the left more hurriedly than the speed at what the others had moved. It was like ! it got to close in error and started to become a darker orange! and red streaks developed in a couple places before it stopped moving. At the same time the one on the left was becoming a very pale, almost clear orange, to the point where I saw the top fray as if to release something and regain its form all in about a second or two‚Äôs time. At this same time the one on the right was beginning to regress or move back. This is the only time I saw one reverse direction. It started to return to a more medium or stable orange. This is when I saw something, I don‚Äôt know. The one that went pale all of a sudden had a panel on its left as I faced it. The panel turned, expanded in width or thickness, and outward as well. It then immediately contracted, turned back, rippled and looked like night sky again. Then a panel on the bottom followed suit. At this point it turned back to red, as they all had done as they moved on, then it jettisoned or repositioned upward to the left in the sky. Then was followed by the remaining ones. I could see the hydraulics to ! whatever I was witnessed. The design. The movements. The stages. The last one to pass, like the first, was also red. If I can add anything else to this I will.",

I'd gone for a weekend with some of my girlfriends and I'd fallen asleep on the couch for awhile.  All but one of my friends had gone to bed.  She called me out onto the porch to look at the night sky.  It had been a rainy day and cloudy night.  It was a dark but still somehow luminescent night of clouds.  In the far distance was a slit of fiery glow from the power plant on the other side of Lake Anna.  As I looked toward a dark corner of the sky, I noticed a dark wavering before a sea of luminescent clouds.  I felt as though I was seeing it track the movement of my friend so I thought it was her shadow.  But, I knew it was impossible for that to happen given the lack of light from the correct angle to cast it where it floated.  As that understanding was making its way into my conscious understanding,  I saw that my friend stood still but the dark wavering kept going.  It was an enormous black sheet, filmy, slipping around at its borders the way an amoeba does.  When we understood we were seeing something very strange that neither of us had ever seen before, we went in the house and locked the doors.  That scared us.  We have tried various internet searches and have yet to find anything remotely like it.",

Early Friday Morning 4/25/97 at approximately 1:45 AM (worked late) I was traveling north on Military Trail between Atlantic and Lake Ida Road. I noticed a rather large white light, like a helicopter spot light in the north sky. Then I suddenly noticed a red  light below it. The red light looked like a tower light at first. Then I noticed that it was much wider than a single tower light.  I turned east on Lake Ida road and was alternately watching the road and looking north (to my left) at the lights. The red light was now rectangular in shape and there was some small areas where there was maybe white light by the red.  Then the Large white source became 4 blinking smaller white lights, like 2 lights each on the wing tips of an airplane. The white lights flew to the south above me and then I couldn't find them. The red light started moving rather rapidly to the east. Then I noticed red sparkles horizontally behind  the red light. The sparkles were like fireworks sparkles. The sparkles became a streak and the red light continued moving east very fast and became very small. The sparkles disappeared. The red light became indistinguishable from a star or ordinary airplane light and kept moving east until I couldn't spot it anymore.  When this happened 4/25/97 I documented it and emailed to family.  I just found your web site June 29, 2012 when I saw another strange set of objects and reported them and then report this 1997 incident.",

At end of tube appeared to be a dull metal shield which opened like your top eyelid revealing a man who appeared to be in early 30's with black curly hair w/beard and mustache dressed in white robe seated and appeared to be working controls.  The surface at end of tube appeared to be oval shaped and had black edges with amber color in middle but I could see man inside.  Man never looked at me but I felt like I was not supposed to observe.  I remember remarking &quot;so that's how they do it&quot; as the tube retracted back up to ufo and disappeared into bottom of object.  This took about 25 to 30 seconds. There was no sound. There were no clouds in the sky to obstruct view of object.  There was no wind.  At first I thought it might be a satellite in the sky. I was kind of nervous and felt really strange about what I saw but nothing happened.  I questioned if I really saw what I did see.  I was not afraid of it or that it would harm me.  I just had a sense of curiosity.  I went back into my house for about 5 mins.  I came back out again to take more pics and to see if the object was still there. It was. I decided I would go to my back yard to take pics of more flowers and a crepe myrtle tree.  I then observed the object more nw as if it had moved to observe me.  I tried to take more pictures of the object as I could still see it with my naked eye but could not find it thru the lens of my camera.  I did observe a jet leaving a trail at the time the object was in the sky.  I tried to take several pics at different areas of where ufo was located to see if I could capture it again with my camera but to no avail. When I blew up the picture on my pc, there was a distinct glow of color around object.  There were no wings or obvious fuel tank, etc.  My daughter, who works in Johnson City for the local telephone company, along with fellow employees who were taking a break about 11:30 AM the same day, also saw the same object and many of them thought it was a satellite as well.  They did not observe the tube.  I was able to take 2 pics of ufo but quality was not the best as I had to zoom out my lens to get a picture and only limited zoom on my camera.",

My girlfriend says we were travelling East on Millbrook Road towards Millbrook Collection, which is a shopping center, located at the corner of Millbrook Rd./Atlantic Ave. My girlfriend was driving and since I'm still quite new to the area, I was looking around and noticed, what I believed to be chem-trails, which were all intersecting in one spot in the sky, similar to the shape of an asterisk. Just west of this formation, in the sky, was an airplane which left an extremely long plume of white vapor. In the same area as this plane, was a solid black object, sort of, cylindrical-shaped, with some kind of blurry feature on it. Both the plane and the black object appeared very high. I'm guessing that that plane was at crusing altitude, so what's that, 30,000+ feet?  Well, it appeared that the black object was at least that high. At arms length, the object was about the size of a pencil's eraser. If this object was indeed around the same height as the plane, it must have been 1/4 size in comparison to it. The distance from the object to the plane appeared to be 300-400 yards.  The object made no noise. At first, I thought it was a bird, but it didn't move. I observed this for at least a mile, still in the same spot. At some point, the trees got in my view and i was unable to see it. Once past the trees, I looked and the plane was still there but the black object was gone. I didn't see it again. I've made several reports on this site over the years.  This is the first UFO I've seen and reported in the Raleigh, NC area.  The others were all seen by me and other witnesses in and around the Charlotte, NC area.",

I will have them for two years in my home.  The night they were installed I got a feeling of an energy so much I got up out of bed and went out my back door.  At first, nothing seemed out of order. So I just thought I was having insomnia.  I went to the chair at my small table in the dark and sat for a minute, then glancing to the sky realized it's back!  The hair stood up on the back of my neck and I understood what the ENERGY is.

I happened too look up and saw a large BLACK BLANKET in the sky&lt;it had a slight wrinkle every so often.  Now I am talking blacker than the background of the sky.  Then looking from my home on this street 4 miles from where I live now, at the same time and over the Sangabriel mountains and at the same time their wa! s a large off in the distance round glowing round ball throwing off smaller round balls.  My nieghbors all came out and looked and I called the Sheriff. they arrived one black lady sheriff and I believe a female white driving.  They too looked and just said they could not explaine what we were seeing.  A Black Floating Blanket.  So they left. my niehgbors all went in i watched for two hours went in to get a cup of coffee, then when I came back out it was gone. my sighting at my new home of one year just happened after these black boxes were placed in my home and on the 19th of June 2012 it was back! I pretended I did not see the blanket in the sky although, I felt scared this time.  I just watched from the corner of my eye and it was as though it new of my presence.  Just the feeling I got. It was there an hour I went to the back door pretending not to see it and went to bed.  I peeked out later it was gone.",

I have lived in rural areas my whole life and have never seen anything like this. I am familiar with airplanes and jets, and there is an airport north of my apartment, but I've observed several planes flying to this airport tonight and they were much different from this object, not to mention flying in a completely different direction. Tonight at about 8:29pm, I heard what sounded like an aircraft flying very low and approaching my apartment. The noise was higher in pitch than any aircraft noise I'd ever heard, but a constant whooshing hum. I went outside to see it, because it definitely sounded like it would be in my line of sight, and it was indeed.  The sun had set but the sky was still a light royal blue color, so I could easily make out the solid kite shape of the object: like a diamond, but with a flatter front and elongated back rather than equal sides and angles.  It was gray and had a number of white and yellowish lights. Several lined the front (maybe around 5 to 7), and one was at each corner, and a few of them (if not all) blinked. I believe the lights were shaped differently: some were rectangular while others more round.  The object wasn't extremely low, but low for an aircraft.  It was flying pretty directly east, and I couldn't tell whether or not it was ascending or descending, though it seeme! d to hold a steady altitude.  The object looked familiar to me (probably because of photos on TV of similar-looking UFOs), so I wasn't alarmed upon seeing it, but I was extremely curious and watched it intently.  As it passed behind trees and then the hills that blocked it from my sight, it seemed to turn slightly north.  Even after I could no longer see it, I could still hear it, though the sound decreased out of hearing at a constant rate (meaning it didn't abruptly cut off as though it had landed).",

It was seen in the SW sky, and was hovering completely still in mid-air.  What made it so outstanding were the colorful lights moving along constantly from left to right.  The colors were vivid blue, less green, less red and white.  They were intermittently blinking on and off as they moved along.  Then suddenly, all of the lights would momentarily go off.  Then all at once they became a solid line of bright white light with some brilliant flashes of that bright white light.  Then the colored lights started moving along again.  There appeared to be no repeat pattern.  I reasoned that, even though I couldn‚Äôt see it, the lights were probably circling around something and I could see only one section.  As the stars moved in a clockwise direction, this ‚Äúobject‚Äù very slowly sank to the right (westerly) until it was out of sight.  At any rate, it was the most fascinating thing I have ever witnessed in my life",

     "text":"Big black crystal w shiny top panel hovering high over mountain N of Winnemucca noontime Aug '85 It was a barn-sized object twice as wide as tall shaped much like a downward facing lily with about 6 to 8 long and 4 or so short solid smooth black crystal spikes reaching outward and down from its center. It had a car-sized thin silver rectangular panel on top aimed eastward, angled up at about 45 degrees, shining brightly from sunshine. It \"hovered\" stationary a thousand or so feet over a long mountain ridge a thousand or so feet tall just a couple miles west of highway 95, around 30 to 45 miles north of Winnemucca Nevada, sometime around noon, on a clear hot dry windy summer day with unlimited visibility on a Sunday in August of 1985. I watched the target through a 7x monocular from northeast of it for about 5 minutes as a passenger in a van traveling south on highway 95 at about 60-70 mph, paralleling the mountain ridge. When we got as close to it as the highway was going to allow, I still could not identify what the object was even though I was seeing it clearly. Then, after having driven onward 2 or 3 more minutes southeast of the stationary object, it \"pixillated\" to total invisibility within 2 full seconds of gradually evaporating into thin air. My observation altogether included those several minutes approaching the closest point the highway got to the object and just a couple or few more minutes continuing past, thus allowing me to see it for quite a while from a wide span of angles before it faded into oblivion. My stomach sank as it started to pixillate. Inside me I growled \"don't you dare disappear before I figure you out\"! Then the 2 seconds were up and it was completely gone. I said not a word out loud, however, and never once spoke to anyone of the incident for about 15 years. The 4 other adults in the van initially acknowledged the obvious black stationary target with shiny top panel in the clear blue cloudless sky, but without magnification they paid it little interest as they enjoyed laughter & conversation on our way home from an adventurous weekend on the last day of the Boise Idaho hot air balloon festival which we had just participated in. I haven't yet been able to nail down what exact date that was to the day. I was awake and sharp as ever during my sighting. I had been involved extensively in hot air ballooning for half a decade up till then and nearly a decade since, so have had my eye in the sky observing flying machines quite a bit. The bulky, big black crystal's rock-solid stationary stability during my 7 or more minutes total observation seemed impossible on such a windy day. Its disappearing act was especially confounding.

     "text":"Flickering orange oval hovering over Grants Pass, OR At about 9:00 or 9:30, my mother and I were heading home after visiting my sister who lives in the area.  A few minutes later we were on the highway driving west. I was in the passenger seat and looked out the side window at the buildings and houses spanning the side of the small valley.  That‚Äôs when I saw a small white but translucent oval or spherical object in the sky.  As I looked at it a little bit longer an orange flicker began to appear and get bigger inside of the object, which I first took as a fire, but then realized as I watched that it was not burning and looked more like sequenced flashing lights. As I was watching the object, I was describing it to my mother, who was unable to witness it because she was driving. When the lights were flickering or flashing, the shape became more apparent and looked a bit like this: The bottom appeared to be rounded, but fatter than the top, kind of like an egg. There was a horizontal line that looked like it opened to the inside, in the sense that the lights looked brighter there, in that bar it was pure dark fire orange and black. Above and below that horizontal bar or line the color looked different, it was obscured and looked as it does when someone holds a piece of plain white printer paper close enough to a flame that it blocks the view of the flame, but you can still see the color and flickering through it. At that point I was thinking that maybe it was a project or something that someone was doing, floating a small paper object using a candle to make hot air and all that and I was asking my mom if that was possible. After a few seconds of discussing that with my mom, I observed something that erased all doubt in my mind and confirmed to me that this was indeed a UFO. What I observed was the object suddenly jetted westward a short distance, then jetted eastward, stopped and wobbled for maybe a second at the most and then jetted north and upwards so fast that I completely lost sight within a second. I continued to exclaim to my mom what had happened as I opened my window to see if I could hear anything. I heard nothing but our car on the road, surely if this was an airplane it would have made some sort of noise going that fast, but there was none, and if there was it was quiet. This all happened in an approximate time length of 5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

I would also like to add that we could hear rumbling almost like a train in the distance would sound that would come and go, it would even at times get so creep-ily silent..  I've lived in this house for almost 26 years, this was definitely NOT normal",

     "text":"Black disk shaped object moved across the night sky with 3 bright white central lights and visible outer halo/aura I retain full copyright to the photos I have taken so I cannot directly include them with this report, but here is what I experienced:  I was on my front deck talking to my wife on the phone at around 12:20 AM on June 5 2013, when I noticed a single very bright light appear in the crystal clear night sky over Lawrence Grassy Mountain.  The light looked to be about 5mm across from my current altitude of 4620ft.  There was no sound and it was moving slowly from West to East originating from The Spray Lakes area.  At one point, after it had passed over head, it appeared to hover or change direction to the SE as it stood still in the sky for a good 15-20 seconds then continued off to the East. Frantic  I quickly hung-up on my wife - I took some quick pictures with my iPhone as the object was over head and even attempted to get some video as it hovered to the SE. The object was too high to be a helicopter and had no red or green wing or rotor lights.  I feel the inclusion of the hover or change in direction rules out the ISS or a satellite, also I have seen the ISS and satellites many times and this was too low of an altitude and the size too great to be either of them. I have posted an original unedited picture I captured to my Google Drive and it can be viewed here:  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1nvmKVaxG72TVVsdnRZeWdQMEE/edit?usp=sharing   On a copy of the image I was able to enhance the shadow and highlights to reveal what looks to be a round disk shape (seen as a black ring blocking out the sky behind it) and a thin secondary, yet broken, halo of light that I can only assume is from light being emitted from the top of the object.  It is the most compelling UFO photo I have seen to date and if I hadn‚Äôt seen it with my own two eyes, I would still find the images very hard to explain with any known craft in the skies today. The shadow and highlight enhanced photo can be viewed here:  https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1nvmKVaxG72UzRSai1NRkNpZEk/edit?usp=sharing   Again I retain full copyright on the two images I have provided and as such they cannot be copied or reproduced in any way without my knowledge and signed written consent.",

     "text":"I have an entire armada of different type crafts appear in a short time and it is almost overwhelming! Tonight has been a most unusual night, since the Geminid began there has been many strange objects of \"starlike\" shape, these star shapes are silver and gold with flashing lights of green, blue and red, for each silver object a gold one is positioned beside it at an equal distance, there are 40 or more of these and as said these have been in the sky since the evening of 12/13/02 and appeared to use \"meteor's\" to seed clouds which they then engulfed.   As of last evening they did not make or abosorb any more clouds, all have been stationary with the exception of 2 of which 1 chased an airplane a few nights ago and last night a gold one raced across the sky and became almost cigar shaped.   Tonight the skys are very cloudy with heavy winds, the waether where I live is strange as few rain storms ever come over because they break and split apart prior, the clouds look like they are pouring into a hole at a place a mile or so away{this is the origination of a strange sighting last Sept}, many funnel clouds have formed and made way to this place, being funnel clouds are very common due to the weather pattern they got noticed tonight for pointing downward when usually they just roll across the sky.  Where they form is to the S-SW and were formed as they usually do across the sky but when approaching the convergence of the Westerly& Southerly winds{cause of weather pattern} the funnels pointed downward, when they reached the converging point an oval light would jet down toward the ground, this happened several times so I began retracing from N-S and was amazed to see these ovals hiding themselves in the funnels near where most of them form, when a funnel appeared to be dispersing the oval would come to the end of the tube/funnel and wait for small dark clouds to get near and then would hide behind them, I saw at least 50 do this, they are about the size of a gymnasium maybe even larger. Once I got an idea of what is happening I began to notice the clouds they hide behind if losing their funnel had distinct shapes, ! I was al most unsure if I could stand it all, some clouds had the shape of a flying V and bigger than the ovals and others triangular and yet some were chevron shaped, I saw 20+ of these. When I began looking thru my binoculars I could see ver faint red/range blue and green dots covring the chevron shaped objects and last Sept. there were hundreds of the red/orange going into the sky, up then as if dancing then across the horizon with equal distance between, they appeared to be the same or similar dots, as well last Sept. the red dots appeared to be fighting with something to resemble a red dragon almost like a phoenix but not quite, the battle happened almost overhead but at once the stars seemingly exploded{may have been the \"starlike\" objects here now but I was'nt paying that much attention then} after a heavy fog covered most of the sky but left open the place from where they came from the ground, after 9/11/01 and this madness going on we contacted the Sheriffs Dept who responded with 4 deputies, most of the red balls were gone but 2 graciously appeared above a dead pine just as the deputies were writing me off as a \"Knut\", they had little to say about and I jokingly stated it probably to be \"Swamp Gas\" then they left, several nights later an octagonal craft came from the south going north{the UFO hole}, it had faint blacklights surrounding the edge but were on the underside, had 2 big lights across the face which resemble a ZZTop album cover and a rectangular set of red lights that would flash differently as if it were some type of communication, this craft is able to hover and move horizontal at great speeds, if I focused my binoculars a bit off te starlike objects could well be similar but the stars would have been made of several of these hex ones, I have several witnesses for each account !!! Back to tonights show, as well as the starlike, the red/orange dots, the chevron, triangular and Vshapes there were smaller ovals but they had a more oblong appearence. The small ovals did not use funnels but seemed to hold white clouds together and move from south to north as did the others, these would sometimes be in small groups of 4 or 5 in the same cloud, they moved on the clouds bottomside and disappeared as did the others. Where the sky breaks the incoming storms approximately 2 miles south I would see a flicker now and then but with all the excitement it took a while to give them much attention, once I focused on them I saw small green, blue and red semi-cigar shapes that would scramble behind the clouds anytime a clear spot appeared, there were too many small dot and semi-cigar shapes to try to count. As of now the event is still happening and while peering out my sliding glass doors a gigantic rounded hexagonal shape with a bulging circle in the center just came over using a dark cloud for concealment. I have an idea that I may be near a centralized location for some sort of being that is capable of technology beyond ours, that uses things from the atmosphere for an unknown purpose, is very diverse and that lives under ground as a large society of sorts as well as occasionally emerging and re-entering for the reason of stockpiling whatever it is they take from the atmosphere/clouds. Apparently they are peaceful enough because I have had nor heard of any encounters with them other than sightings. I also believe I may be in way over my head in trying to unvail any more information alone, where would one begin to look for help ??? I am going to close now and continue observing and will gladly inform you all of anymore findings !",

The witnesses included myself, a neighbor and his son.  My neighbor had already been witnessing the event for fifteen minutes when I joined them.  We observed several red lights, moving unusually fast from the Southeast direction at a diagonal towards the Northwest. For an estimated 40 minutes total, they kept coming, 60 seconds to 3 minutes apart, following the same diagonal trajectory; initially in pairs, then one after another. Immediately, we noticed that this was not any aircraft, airplane or helicopter, as the red light was disembodied, and pulsing/ flickering irregularly (like a candle) as opposed to uniform regular flashing as with a helicopter.  The red lights also seemed to have a red halo.  They also seemed to be close enough (at helicopter height) that we should have been able to make out the body had it been a man-made aircraft. The movement was unusual: it would zoom from the horizon in a quick burst, then stop and remain stationary for a minute or two, before shooting straight up into the atmosphere and disappearing at an incredible speed.  Sometimes, after coming to a stop, they would slowly turn in meandering half circles, before shooting up. At one point, one of these red lights shot up close to passing airplane (we live close enough to the airport to see several passing planes at various heights) and we were able to observe that it began below the plane and shot up above it as it made its ascent at tremendous speed. I personally observed a total of 6, with my neighbor claiming to have witnessed 11 total.",

     "text":"On the night of Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 at 4:30 in the morning I woke up and had to use the restroom.  I am 70 years old so at my age I cannot sleep through the night. I went to the stool room of the bathroom and while there I looked out the window and saw an object that was not familiar to me.  It was an object that was about the size of our refuse container.  It was about four feet high and four feet wide.  It was black in color.  It was sitting on my neighbor‚Äôs driveway in the sidewalk portion in the drive.  The direction from me to the object was north/northeast.  It had a white light on the side near the top ‚Äì the size of it was one inch by five inches.  It pulsed every two seconds but did not go completely out during the low side of the light.  The object was about 80 -100 feet from my position.  The unusual thing about the object was there were no definitive edges.  The house, driveway, lawn and street looked as normal.  The black object looked as if it shimmered slightly.  It was black but not a dark solid black with lighter streaks going through it horizontally though they were faint.  The only other thing that was not normal was that my ne! ighbor had installed Christmas lights on the lawn next to the driveway.  The lights were not on at that time. I went back to the window two more times ‚Äì the second time I went back to the bedroom then back to the window.  The third time I went into the bathroom and then back to the window.  This was a Saturday night and we had stayed home -- I did not have an alcoholic drink that night nor have I ever in my life used any kind of recreational drugs. The amount of time I observed the object was about five minutes.  After this I went back to bed and told my wife about it the next morning.  At that time it did not concern me but the next night I was a bit ‚Äúspooked‚Äù by it though nothing else was sighted. The next afternoon my wife and I went across the street to my neighbor‚Äôs driveway to see there were any kind of marks that might have been left on the concrete there was nothing  About thirty years ago I noticed a white light that followed me and didn‚Äôt have any idea what it was.  This white light followed me for about sixty miles while driving in central Kansas.  This black object was so much closer and seemed so much more real.",

     "text":"Bedroom Invasion This is not a U.F.O. sighting report. I had contact with alien beings in my bedroom. I hope this is the proper place for such a report. It happened sometime in 2013.  I was in bed sleeping, when at approximately 3a.m.  I was woken up after feeling something touch my forehead. I opened my eyes, and I saw that my bedroom was flooded in a sort of red color. I was lying on my back and I looked up the wall above my headboard, and was shocked to see a doorway coming out of my wall.  There were two men side by side, and I could see a stairway going up into total darkness,  The men appeared to be wearing leather jackets!  They appeared to me men and both had thick wavy black hair. One of them pointed what I thought was a gun at my forehead, and for a second, I really though I was going to be shot in the head. I was partially paralyzed, but I was able to raise my right arm enough to actually get a hole of the man holding the \"guns wrist\" I then saw what looked like tiny blue lights where the open end of a gun's barrel would be. There was a dull white light slightly larger than the tiny blue lights which went around the tip of the \"gun\" in a circle. I saw that it was not a gun, but it was roughly the same shape as a hand gun, only a little thicker down the barrel and tapering off where the lights were. It appeared to be some kind of shiny plastic.  They put the tip of the gun like instrument against my forehead, and at that point, both men has a perplexed expression on their faces. It appeared that they were confused at whatever it was they may have been expecting to see. I managed to push the man's wrist up and away from my head, with what seemed to me to be very little effort. I had the feeling that they were not allowed to resist me if I attempted to push them away. That is why, I afterwards, reasoned that I managed to push his hand away so easily. Suddenly, they were just gone, and my wall was normal again. It took a while for me to be able to move normally, and I was able to see my wife had slept right through the entire episode. There was a dim red glow on my ceiling for about ten or so minutes after they had disappeared. I could see red catching the tiny lumps off my stuccoed ceiling for quite some time as it slowly dissipated. I didn't have any fear except for slightly, when I thought I was going to be shot, but even then, not as much fear as I would expect to have had my life actually been threatened like that. It seemed to me whoever they were, they were able tocontrol my emotions and my body. A few months after that experience, I was watching a television program, where investigators were attempting to make contact with \"ghosts\" Ghost Adventures, was the name of that show. I saw one of their cameras had the exact same color of blue, and the exact same size and configuration as the instrument which had been used on my forehead. The camera itself was much bigger, but the tiny blue lights were the same size. It turned out to be an infra red camera. I thought they all used red lights, however, this camera, used blue. My wife had no recollection of anything out of the ordinary, nor did our three adult sons. I have not had any further incidents. The experience was real, not a dream, of that I am certain. I am a bible believing Christian, and I honestly feel that kept them from doing whatever it was they had come to do. Thank you for your time. J.C.",

Looking out my second story bedroom sliding glass door, in the north west sky, I saw what I first thought was a very brilliant multicolored star.  I put on my glasses and knew it wasn‚Äôt a star.  Red, blue, green, white lights were glittering in an indeterminate pattern on a stationary object.  Occasionally, the lights were a crystal white bright, but always changing and moving.  The object did not move up and down at all, nor did it appear to move toward or away from me.   I grabbed binoculars and that improved my view a bit, but the object seemed to be quite far away.  I awakened my spouse who confirmed he saw the same thing.  After about 20 minutes the oject tilted to the right, maybe a 20-30 degree angle, then stayed in that position for the duration of my ability to view it.   The lights continued to glitter, change color and move mostly from the left to the right of the object, but sometimes the colored lights moved more up and down.   Nearing 0330, the fog began to roll in and the object seemed to sink very slowly, over about a 5‚Äì10 minute time frame, until I was no longer able to see it at all.",

I checked the ISS schedule, but knew I wouldn't find it listed as flying by.  I've seen the ISS before & this object was larger/lower in the sky and I could make out a shape vs. the ISS's large all white light image.",

     "text":"Multiple event over 10 years. UFO Report  I am writing this down for the first time in my life.  I am 57 yrs old, these things I swear by all that matters are true and did happen to the best of my recollection over the course of my life in Corpus Christi, Texas. 1st contact with strangeness: The summer of 1967 was very hot, muggy as I recall.  One day in june or July of that year 3 men dressed in black suits, white shirt, black ties and black sunglasses appeared (actually I saw them walk up the steps)on front porch screen door.  They knocked and stood very erect and still together, they looked like candles as recall, they were not the same height, but they were very thin, tall and very white.  Their hair was white or blond and appeard plastered to their heads with wavy plastered curles on their foreheads. I came to the door and asked what they wanted.  One of them bent down and stuck his nose close to the screen door at eye-level with me (I was 10 yrs old) and asked me‚Ä¶‚Äùwhere are your parents?‚Äù  I told him that my folks were at work and he said‚Ä¶.‚Äùwell they should be home, tell them we came looking for them.‚Äù  This was sorta not done in a nice manner and rather scared me.  My big sister (she was 13 yrs old) and I her room, I backed away from the door and yelled out her name to come to the door.  The turned around t walk down the steps to their car, a long black Lincoln or what looked like a crown Victoria.  I turned to look to see if my sister was coming to door, when I turned around back to the screen door to look down the porch at them men walking to their car to get in it, they weren‚Äôt there, they and the car were gone.  I never saw them get in car, I never heard the car start, nor did I ever see the car drive away down the street. 2ND EVENT:  Over the course of the next year or so, 1967 to 1968, my parents, mainly my dad, began complaining about a pain in his heel.  Eventually, he had me look at his right foot heel for some sort of splinter or spur that he thought was stuck in his heel.  My dad had me probe his heel with needle where he thought the pain was.  I did this over the course of several weeks looking for this thing my dad thought he had in his heel.  Eventually, I was able to dig out of my dad‚Äôs heel this chip or sliver of metal, it was thin and small but very visible.  It was metal or at least had glint like metal, aluminum.  A few months later, my dad removed a piece of metal from my mom‚Äôs heel and my sister‚Äôs heel.  I had one in my foot pad that I took out, too. 3RD EVENT:  In the summer of 1970, August 3rd, Corpus Christi was devastated by hurricane Celia, it wiped out the city, martial law was imposed, the National Guard shot and killed 9 looters over the course of the next two months.  We were without power or electricity until mid-October of that year.  Soon after power was restored, one night in my outside my bedroom window, late at night, very bright red and blue lights appeared in backyard.  The lights moved up and down through a very heavily branched cedar tree.  I didn‚Äôt get up out of bed because I was way too scared to see.  Later that night, I woke up and I am not sure if I was hallucinating and seeing small little people with big fat heads and very big eyes in room looking around.  I put the covers over head and wished they would go away.  Nothing else happened then I fell asleep. 4TH EVENT:  Summer, July 1976, cabinis field Baseball Park.  Divisional game between Carroll high and king high.  Skylab is in orbit.  During the middle of game the PA announcer who is calling the ball game, says that skylab will be visible to the crowd (about 2500people) as it makes its orbit around earth.  The PA announcer knows the exact time and the direction from which skylab will appear from the horizon, I believe he told everyone to look to the southeast of cabinis field, as I looked up to the ‚Äòclear blue sky‚Äô, directly out of the south in clear view came an object it was cylindrical, dark and gray, had no markings, some external equipment and crooked arm sticking out of it with red glowing bulb at the end of the crooked arm.  It was clearly visible, the PA announcer and another man in the booth began to argue about the object and it begin too low and not coming from the correct direction.  The object came directly over the ball field, not more than a few hundred to a thousand feet, it! s details were very visible to me.  The men in the PA booth of the ballpark continued to argue over the loud speaker about the object finally the head PA announcer said to drop it, nothing more was said. I remember going down the stands to the concession stand and people looking bewildered and dazed.  I got in my car and drove home in disbelief. Over the following years, I had no more interesting events happen to me, things were quiet and calm, but from time to time I have events of precognition or clairvoyance were I find somewhat disturbing.  I have learned to control myself and these precognitive thoughts or clairvoyance and try to lead a good, better life.",

     "text":"Spinning tubular UFO flies and flashes acrross sky while several others in sight in Boring. I had just finished working for the day and I stepped out side outside about 11:30 pm to look for my cat.  So I'm walking around and I take a gander at the sky because it looked beautiful, and I see what looks like a little yellow light bouncing around.  Shorty after seeing the yellow one, I notice a blue one beneath it doing the same thing. just bouncing slightly. I mentally debate if what I'm seeing if actually moving at all, and my vision is observing it wrong, then all of a sudden the blue one does a full circle in a split second, just WOOOSH!, then back to where it was like it just answered my question for me. At this point my jaw is at the floor, and Im just watching waiting for more. So I look at the 2 lights for a number of minutes, I'm going to guess 5.  I felt like taking my eyes away from the sky would have been a mistake so I kept my eyes locked. After a bit of time passes I see in the corner of my eye, a tubular long object with a light along it that looked like a flowing lightening bolt. It was emanating from the body of the object and flowing like a beam of electricity. On both ends there was bright flashing lights too. I see this objecting spinning in full circles and traveling extremely fast while its spinning. So it comes from out of my vision to into my vision along the horizon, so it blows right past the other 2 hurdling by, absolutely blowing my mind, then it disappears for a split second, completely black, couldn't see it, then it reappears, and the lights on it are going completely insane and flashing up a storm and skipping from one area of the sky to another like it was literally teleporting across the sky in different places. it disappeared while it was on the left side of the sky, then reappeared on the right side, lights going absolutely crazy the whole time. It did that off into the distance till I couldn't see it any more. At this point I am completely rethinking my entire life and what I believe in. The 2 yellow and blue ones where still there, bouncing. Then I feel a bump on my back and it was my cat, and he sat there with me, and acted strange, like he knew to me. Like he was trying to comfort me, and help me be calm. So I took some deep breaths and tried to call somebody to try make some sense of what just happened. Nobody took me seriously after calling 2 people. Feeling like I'm wasting my time I go back outside. I look up and I see a star sized light to the naked eye. It is flashing back and forth between red and blue and white. Flashing pretty quickly. I cant believe my eyes so I go inside and grab my camera. After mounting my tripod I zoomed in as far I could, and the object became allot larger in the camera. It was a perfect circle. Spinning in one direction flashing, then it changed the direction it was spinning. The color flashes weren't consistant at all and where at times getting really fast, then it would slow down, and it would be brighter white, the faster it spinned. After being fixated on that one for nearly 45 minutes, the spinning tube one came back just spinning across the sky.  I managed to snap one picture of it, where you can see the beam of light that went along the whole thing. It came and went allot faster than the first time. I took pictures and videos of the spinning disc till my camera died. Hungry for more I go inside and charge my camera in hopes to get more footage because I felt like I couldn't get footage that was good enough. Once my camera was charged I went back outside and it was covered in clouds and I couldn't see a thing. While I was inside I did allot of thinking and this sighting changed my life in many powerful ways. I felt blessed. I feel like a fool for not reporting sooner, I thought it would be smart to do it, then to let it go unheard.",

     "text":"Big grey-black rectangular ufo flying really slowly. Lately, I've been thinking about this event that I had put in the back of my mind and I wanted to get some answers, now that I started doing some research and knowing that UFOS really exist. I was 11 years old, sitting in school and when I looked outside the window, I saw this huge rectangular shape flying really really slowly (maybe 5-10km/h) in the clear blue sky.  I'm 100% sure it wasn't a plane or helicopter, balloon or whatever.   It was grey or black I can't remember and there was some sorts of tubings or smaller rectangular shapes on it.   I'm the only witness because I didn't dare to ask anyone else if they were seeing it,  I was kind of hypnotized and feeling so calm, it's weird to describe.   I saw it for about 20 seconds until I couldn't see it because of the window. I never thought much about it, kinda forgot about it, until now.  I'm really curious to know if there is any other similar ufo sightings (I havn't seen a lot of rectangular ufos on the internet) and if you know what kind of alien species have this type of engine?   Thank you",

The light stayed on for several minutes then just went out.  There was several red lights on the object that weren't extremely bright like an aircraft would have and had only red lights no other colors. The object moved off to the left, our viewpoint was going to be blocked by a mountain so we ran towards it to get a longer look at the object. It was at that time we thought we may have saw more than one but with our excitement and hearts pounding it was hard to tell if it was just my nerves or shakeing causeing me to think stars were moveing. At that time the object moved overhead of us and appeared low in altitude.  It had several red lights and two on the rear were blinking.  It made no sound and for an object to be so low I didn't understand what was propelling it?  This experience has rarely left my mind since it occurred, hardly a day goes by without me thinking of it at least once.",

This fire ball was not a plane, it zig-zagged a little as it came forward.  It flew just under the clouds and we had a clear view.  It then veered to the left and disappeared for a few minutes, then the huge oval shape turned black when the fire disappeared.  At that point it looked like a dark rectangular parachute against the slightly lit night sky. It went down to the northeast, the \"parachute\" seeming to land behind the trees to the northeast of us. We were stunned when we looked back where it had come from and saw another ball of fire coming from the same direction.  This one followed a straighter path from southeast to northwest.  This fireball also disappeared, changing  into a black spot in the sky, and seemed to go down behind the trees in the distance to the northwest.

The object initially had the apparent size of about 1.5 moon diameters.  Object was at about 15-20 degrees elevation observed from my location, and very slowly traveled south southeast.  Best guess at altitude, less than 5000 feet.  The object gave the impression of being roughly rectangular shaped, with the long dimensions oriented north-south.  When observed early on with binoculars, the object gave a hint of a grey to charcoal black color. Multiple orange lights were observed at various points along the object and a bright red flashing light, perhaps at the rear or underside, was visible the entire duration of sighting.  The orange lights appeared to change position/orientation or turn on/off as the object traveled, giving the impression that it may have rotated or turned left/right on a few occasions but always maintaining its south southeasterly course.  The red flashing light did not appear to be perfectly rhythmatic as it seemed to occasionally vary the length of duration on or off. The object spent about 20 minutes moving south and slightly east towards the Siskiyou National Forest area until blocked by trees and my local terrain.",

     "text":"I was taken to an alien laboratory from my bedroom. ((NUFORC Note:  We have tried to contact the source of the report, principally to inquire whether the report is a sincere one, or whether it might be a hoax.  PD)) Last Thursday night, I was sleeping at home, when I woke up with the feeling that somebody was breaking in my house.  I went to have a look, and as I went to get up out of bed, I found myself paralyzed in place.  I felt really scared, like I was having a nightmare or something.  When I tried to close my eyes, I couldn‚Äôt close them, and I looked around up in the air, I assumed myself to be in a dream, but I couldn‚Äôt wake up, so I started scream, and before I could get a sound out in a single second, I was floating above my bed and I felt a deep very low frequency hum like a large transformer was inside my body.  Then I could see behind me back at my bed, and my cat, who sleeps by me, didn‚Äôt even seem to care or notice that I wasn‚Äôt in my bed anymore.  I was absolutely terrified and right, as I was about to scream, I started floating toward my wall of my bedroom. To my shock, I went right thru the wall, like I was a ghost or the wall was liquid, and as I saw thru my wall, I was feeling this vibration intensify greatly, like a force of my body was going to explode from inside out.  I passed out completely, and when I remember waking up, I realized that I was in some type of white science looking laboratory room of some sort.  I again, assumed I was dreaming, until I saw a face looking down at me.  It was a large head, with black bug-like eyes, and in my head as I went to scream, I heard it say don‚Äôt be afraid of me, you are safe with me.  I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but it said it thru my brain, like a mind reader would read your mind.  The voice sounded like I was saying it to myself, instantaneously to myself. Then I went to ask, what‚Äôs going on, and before I could talk, again it said don‚Äôt worry, and said we‚Äôre zeta brothers.  I didn‚Äôt really understand what that means, but as I could see more clearly, I immediately noticed, that the! se weren‚Äôt people at all, it was an oblong looking bug eyed grey skinned, probably around 3 feet tall, with a silver suit made of some kind of spandex.  It had a tiny little slit where the mouth was, and just holes for ears.  It's head was wobbling on what I remember thinking was a tiny neck right in the middle, and it's hands looked like they were really skinny and long, with almost no texture, just like the texture of the lining of a hot dog casing.  This thing that I can only explain look wise, as an alien creature. When I asked it to go home, another one came in the room, and they were talking to each other without talking, and one said, something in a weird sounding almost African type of language, and they came back next to me but in an instant, no walking, just teleporting back to above me, and the other of the two took off my pants, and put a strange circular light orb on my genitals, and it was very painful.  I immediately felt as though I was being burned on my penis, and it then took the ball off me, and the pain instantly stopped. Then the one holding the light ball disappeared in a flash out of my view, and the other above me said I want to show you him, and a different taller bright white one of these things came out walking with what looked like a little girl, but with some of the facial features of these creatures, and it looked up at me and said ‚Äúyou know who I am‚Äù, This scared me terribly and immediately I remember falling back asleep. When I woke up again, it was the next morning and I was back lying in my bed, without my covers being disturbed, and immediately assumed it was very scary nightmare.  Then, I when I went to get out of bed, my ankle felt as though the same vibrational burning sensation was coming from under my skin by my bone in my leg, so I looked down, and noticed that there is a small maybe 1/8th of an inch circular cut out and burned mark on my leg, but it goes down like 4 layers of my skin, as if someone had literally punched a hole with a paper punch out of it, and then burned it closed.   For the past few days, I haven‚Äôt really been able to tell if this was a dream, or real, but strange feelings happen to my leg and I hear weird static sounds in my head when I feel it.  I keep also, seeing a strange pattern of a triangle, with two circles in it, which looks like some sort of geometric constellation when I start to fall asleep every night since.  I don‚Äôt know still if I was just dreaming of this, or if it really happened, but I can't explain why I am still feeling and seeing weird things, or the hole on my leg I found the morning after this all happened.",

I immediately grabbed a pair of binoculars and confirmed that it was very large, and rectangular in shape.  It was moving slowly North, much like a blimp would move, but it was too big to be a blimp (given how far away it was), and it was not rounded on the ends like a blimp, but squared on all four corners. I then called my brother out to the balcony (we are both retired teachers in our fifties).  He came out and agreed that it was unlike anything he‚Äôd ever seen, that it was far away (again, about eight miles), black, rectangular in shape, and huge.  We watched it for about a minute as it slowly moved to the north, and then out of sight behind the wall of our apartment building. It was a clear day, with no clouds in the sky.  The object moved smoothly, and slowly.  There were no lights on the object, or any other features that we could see.  We could hear no sound associated with it.

November 2008, about 5 minutes past 8:00 pm.  I'm walking home alone from a friend's house.  Something catches my eye on the night sky.  It looks like it appears to be a black balloon drifting above the sheet metal factory that's located above my block as I'm thinking.   I keep my eyes on it with the intentions of watching the balloon until it drifted away and was no longer in sight.  But this object didn't do just that, it paused in mid air.  Once that happened, I slowly jogged closer to the sheet metal factory to get a much better view.  What I then seen in the sky was a perfect black circle with a thin white rim around it. Very still and not moving but floating above the metal factory.  I was the only person outside at the time.  On usually a bright busy street it seem very still and somewhat dark that night, for the circle to be darker than the sky.  My cell phone wasn't advanced enough to take a good photo of the object so I figured why waste my time trying to record ! for such poor quality.   I keep my eyes on the object for a good 15 seconds.  Suddenly, the white door beside the sheet metal factory on Wyncote avenue opens up and out came a African American male wearing all black.  Long sleeve black shirt, black pants, and black boots.  This man was standing directly under the object floating about the building.  He smoothly lit up his cigarette staring at me from across the street, but I gave him temporary attention and looked back up at the object.  Then in a quick second, the object disappears.  Not saying a word to the man in black across the street.   I anxiously run to my house and tell everyone the exclusive news.  This happened at the very exact location of me meeting the strange Asian like man in black.  This took place many months close to a year after my first encounter.

I was traveling home to Oatman from Kingman on my motorcycle.  I had been at Chillin on Beal Street.  A local classic car event.  I remember leaving early, as my battery in my motorcycle was weak and I wanted to get through the Black Mountains mountains before dark. I turned onto the Oatman Rd (Historic Route 66) in Golden Valley. I had 20 miles to go to reach Oatman and the sun was falling.  Riding due west I would be riding directly into the sun.  Golden Vally is rather expansive area between the Black mountains to the west, the Hualapai mountains to the S East and Cerbats to N East.  While on my motorcycle I have habit of always scanning the area I ride.  Looking from side to side, especially for animals that may be near the road. I was approximately 3-4 miles along that 12 mile stretch before reaching the mountains when looking to my left something caught my peripheral vision to look up. There, I saw what I could best describe as a metallic looking, semi-cylindrical object.  My best description would be it was shaped like an airstream trailer, cylindrical with rounded ends.  The underside appeared flat and was dark (shadowed) the upper shining as the sun was bright and there were no clouds in the sky.   The craft seemed to be rising or hovering.  It's hard to discern the exact height or size, but if you extend your arm and hand fully, it would be about as wide as two fingers.   It had no wings or appendages, and if it made a sound, I could not hear it, as I was riding and could only hear wind and exhaust note from my bike.  I will say with certainty it was not a balloon or dirigible.   I stared at it for a short time trying to register in my mind what I was seeing, at which time I turned my head to correct my steering as I was drifting into oncoming lane.  I then looked back up to view it again and it was gone.  I pulled to the side of the road and scanned the sky in all directions with a view of 20 miles or more in all directions and could not see it.  I continued on home all the while searching the sky for it but never saw it again.",

I kept my eyes on them on and off as I drove Eastward myself on Artesia Blvd (and Slausson) to the restaurant.  I pulled into the restaurant parking lot, and just as I was looking for a spot, I noticed that the lights were fading out.  No change in flight path.  Soon afterwards they disappeared entirely.  It was unclear whether there was low cloud cover in the distance that was obscuring the view to the lights - the sky was dark so it was impossible to tell.  But the lights never re-appeared. I'm a student pilot and aerospace engineer, so have a background in aircraft spotting.  These seemed very peculiar.",

Event started with two white starlike/satellite-like craft traversing the sky from North to South and \"parking\" in the sky above SE Grand Rapids area.  Then two multi-colored light, triangular vehicles moved from West to East and parked it in the Eastern Sky, estimating 10-20 miles east of GR at around 2,000ft alt.   Then a black meteor looking thing traversed the sky from the North, where the two satellites came from, to the South (near over the GRRFord airport) and the black object vanished on the Southern Horizon (I've got buildings around so I can't see the real Horizon).   A few seconds after the black object traversed the sky, a triangle of stars in the Southern sky, which I had previously not noticed except that they were there for at least 15 minutes while I was talking on the phone to my fiancee, suddenly moved in unison as if they were falling out of the sky down and to the left (as if in the direction of the black object's trajectory terminus).   I opened the porch door to tell my night nurse to come see the UFOs and she came out and saw another \"star\" fall out of the sky toward the same spot.  She freaked out and ran back inside afraid. I watched for awhile to see if anymore activity, but only saw a few of the \"blinkies\" (stars that blink on and off and move around a little - which I usually only see in thunderclouds).  The \"parked\" stars vanished while I was watching the triangle drop.   Whole thing seemed like either a greeting party or an interference party for whatever that black thing was.",

The moon was almost full, half of the sky was clear and the other half had low incoming clouds.  The object flew through the direct moonlight but there was no moonlight reflection on the object as if the object surface was a flat black.   The object seemed to slow down and hover as it reached a large group of clouds and became harder and harder to see, its outline became vague and soon, I could no longer spot it.  It seemed to camouflage itself against sky.  When it was against the clear sky, it was impossible to see until it was in the moonlight.  It ended up kind of blending with the clouds it approached.  Size wise, it was smaller than a 747, but larger than a minivan.   My boyfriend didn't have his glasses on so he did not see the details I did but he did see its movement.

I see them all the time.‚Äù  His friend thought my statement to be strange; she suggested we go inside but at first, I wasn‚Äôt afraid because I see them all the time.  She was so frightened that she left.  My fiancee decided that we needed to record this, so he went inside to look for my real camera.  Now I will describe what we saw. On Bryden St., between Joy Rd and Livernois, we spotted 12 orange orbs popping up in threes to the left of the sky just over Dearborn, Michigan, Warren Ave, and Wyoming area if you were facing west like we were.  The orbs appear from nowhere low in the sky and slowly floated up over the clouds.  Once they got high over the clouds, they changed to match the clouds they became the same color and even made themselves appear the same texture as the clouds, however, they had become disc shaped.  Once in this form, they floated across the sky towards us which was north to joy from Dearborn.  They appeared to glide across the sky, and they were silent.  Once directly over my hear I could see two dark gray circles on the bottom of the craft spinning.  Once they got just across Joy Rd almost to Chicago on Central, they began to lower they turned dark grayish black and dropped down from the sky to the ground. At that point, I was crying and panicking because I never saw them do that before, and they seemed to be trying to be invisible, and I was terrified, so I ran into the house crying.  I called my best friend the only person who would believe such a crazy story, and she doesn't believe in ufo, but she believes in me‚Ä¶ she calmed me down and told me to pack an emergency bag just in case.  Last night I could barely sleep I was so scared.  I woke up today trying to tell myself it wasn't real.  I have no one to turn to, and life feels very different to me now.  I don't know what to think or how to feel or how to function without feeling like I'm going insane.  I hope that rant made sense.",

I was right, because at approximately 04:30 I began what seemed like lucid d! reaming.  I recalled my consciousness becoming illuminated and seeing internet pages and and stuff yet I was still asleep.  I had a thought like 'had I taken or been given some kind of drug that's causing this?'   I then heard or received a telepathic message assuring me that I had not.  It was like it read my thoughts. I then heard a machine-like noise in my head which woke me up completely.  I then felt a total sense of calm and silence.  Whatever it was had scanned me somehow.",

On September 4, 2018, at 7:20 p.m. in Deming, New Mexico, my wife and I saw a stationary ball of bright white light in the western sky at about 30 degrees.  There we no other stars or planets in the sky because the sky was still too bright.  I thought it was a supernova!   I ran to our shed and got my telescope which is pre-assembled and is covered only by a garbage bag making it always ready to go.  As I looked at the white ball with the telescope, it ejected two smaller orange balls of light.  They were flying in the area below the white ball.  All three objects could be seen with the naked eye. As I was scanning the area near the white ball with my telescope, I saw another object that looked somewhat similar to a Harrier jet.  It was stationary and was facing me nearly head-on with one bright white light in the middle of each wing.  It seemed to be fairly close to the white ball.  We could not see the jet-shaped object without the telescope.  I have no way to tell how large or how far away they were.  After about a minute or two, the jet-shaped object and the big white ball instantly disappeared leaving the two smaller orange balls.  They would alternate between being bright and dim.  The orange balls remained flying around in the same area of the western sky for about thirty seconds before fading from view. This whole event seems to me to have lasted only about 3 or 4 minutes.  If I would taken the time to get my camera and put it on a tripod so I could take some telephoto shots,  I would have missed the seeing the mysterious jet-shaped object.  I have since spoken with three other people who saw the big white object and one small object below the big one!  They did not have the advantage that I had--a telescope!",

It was only one single craft, and due to its size and low flight above our home, it blocked out the night sky as it hovered slowly past. I was frozen in the spot, and didn't even think to run and try to capture the image on my phone, which wasn't on me.  At each of the four corners were red blinking lights.  The shape was definitely flat and rectangular, like nothing I have ever seen in my life. The craft glided by for about 60 long seconds, and slowly drifted out of my line of sight, over the trees.  As it got further away, the lights turned to look bluish, and I could no longer see the detail of the round lights.  I called my husband right away, as he had already left for work, and then I called to report it to the local police, who had not received any other calls and didn't know how to respond. I was very scared to witness this, and am still having a hard time coming to terms with it.  I know it was much too large to be a drone of any type, and all other indications about its shape, sound, height, and movement prevent me from believing it was anything identifiable as man made.

At one point I thought it was a Harrier air craft but I know that sound and look. This had no sound and did not look like a Harrier. Facing them; it was red, white, white, red. In the oblong shape. The Upfront lights were. NOT ONCE DID IT MOVE.  NOT A PLANE OR HELICOPTER. POSSIBLY A REALLY LARGE DRONE. I kept my eyes on the oblong object.  Expecting it to move across.  It stayed directly over rte 95 North side. Me on my motorcycle I slowed down.  While keeping an eye on it.  I looked directly up while passing under wear it.  Directly over me while I was riding underneath it I saw four dull white lights straight down.  In a square pattern with a dull orange look. A black line was horizontal in the middle of the square.  While looking up at it.  The four lights not bright at all, but a dull orange look to the four of them. Around the square was a mantra ray shape all black around the square. Inside the manta ray shape but, the box with the black line in this shape was brown, but the manta ray shape was black. I plan to paint this on something.  Soon..  Inside the time I left Peobody, Mass., concert.  Sometime between 8:15 pm and 8:45  I saw this object. My 360 tracker  app should show me the time I went under this object hopefully. I remember saying WTF is that?  Looking up at it . Then I sped up.  I should have pulled over but it really was not that high up.  So I figured if I could see it; it could see me.  As, I spend up, I tried to look in my bike mirrors and saw nothing. WHY write this down because I can hardly believe what I saw but know I saw something. BELOW A QUICK SKETCH OF FRONT VIEW AND A BOTTOM VIEW  I'D SAY IT WAS LOW ENOUGH TO SEE THE LIGHTS AND BLACK AN BROWN COLOR . BIGGER THEN A HELICOPTER OR PIPER CUB PLANE. HALF THE SIZE OF THE BIGGEST JET. LOOKED LIKE IT WAS JUST SUSPENDED IN THE SKY",

I was returning home from Arizona the evening of August 17, 2018, about 7:40PM PDT.  I was driving north on I-11 (US93-95) and had just passed the Boulder City interchange when I noticed a brilliant light, WNW of my position about 35 degrees above the horizon.  The light appeared to be approaching Black Mountain but was off in the distance, seemingly 10-20 miles away.   I immediately assumed that it was simply a jet on final into McCarran airport, since the jet traffic routinely make their final turns at Black Mountain.  I glanced at it again about 30 seconds later and noticed that it hadn‚Äôt moved in any closer.  Right then the light started to shimmer to a dull orange and went completely black and became a rectangular shaped black object, silhouetted against the dusk sky.  Though the overall object appeared quite small (maybe 1/6 of a full moon) the corners of the rectangle were sharply defined.   I glanced back at it again periodically every few seconds while ! driving and noticed after another 30 seconds a milky tail start to come out of the black rectangular object and cover it in mist.  Five seconds after that it had completely disappeared between my glances at it.  No mist just gone.  I would have assumed it was a meteor viewed face on, had it not been visible for almost 2 minutes in total.",

     "text":"I witnessed a large, dark rectangular craft with at least 7 very bright white orb-ish lights hovering low in the sky over Tucson around 11:00 PM on Tuesday, January 22nd. I was driving North toward the Catalina Mountains when I turned my gaze to the left and was startled by an intense set of lights on a large, pitch-black object which appeared to be within 5-6 blocks West of my intersection.  I was startled by how large the object appeared to be compared to usual aircraft, how close it appeared to me, the intensity and unique semi-linear organization of the lights, and by the fact that the craft appeared to be stationary in the sky.  It was lower than a helicopter would typically be, but was larger and flatter than a helicopter. I immediately pulled over with the intent of getting a picture.  Once I was stopped and facing the object straight on, I noticed the rectangular shape and what appeared to be a projection on the far dorsal surface, with some of the lights set further back on the craft than others (in contrast to the semi-linear arrangement of my initial perspective).  Within about 3 seconds of me getting a good look at it from this view, it began a Southeast descent at only about 10mph faster than what I'd expect from a typical aircraft.   At this point I considered that perhaps it was just a helicopter, but I did not hear any sound as it descended and the shape of the object was more bizarre from the sideview, appearing wide across and essentially flat.  One light flashed a couple of times at a quick/strobe-like rate while the others were larger, had a slightly more yellowish hue, and remained constant. I turned my car back around the way I'd initially come, to try and follow it, but by the time I had stopped at a stop sign and turned South, it had gone.  This seemed unusual to me because my view of the horizon was fairly good, and at the speed I had seen it travelling (55 miles at most) I fully expected to still see it after the ~5 seconds it took to get my car reoriented, but I saw no trace whatsoever. No one in surrounding cars seemed to see it, but I did feel uncomfortable with how low and near me it seemed, and I got the impression that it \"responded\" to me pulling over to face it because it had been hovering in the same spot while I was watching it while still driving, but started descending/moving away a very short time after I pulled over.  The only other thing I can think to note is that there had been a power outage 4-5 hours prior in that area, including outage for the traffic lights of the intersection I was at when I saw the object.",

Side note:  I was driving on my way home when I saw this object.  I was in mid conversation with my wife and subconsciously stopped in the middle of the road and  became fixated on this object.  I stepped out of my truck and just stared at it.  It was completely quiet.  Even during movement it did not produce a sound.  It was by far the largest object that I have ever seen in the sky.  The shape was unlike any plane, helicopter, etc. that I have ever seen.  My wife apparently kept asking what was wrong and all I could say was ‚Äúhold on.  Wow that‚Äôs crazy...what the??‚Äù  Apparently I was so captivated by what I was seeing  that I  couldn‚Äôt put it into words.  After getting home I thought about calling the local police department and reporting it but did not do so for fear of any potential backlash.  I wish I could figure out what it was and hopefully provide some closure for myself.  I keep telling myself it‚Äôs probably something top secret military etc., and hopefully it is, but as of now I have been unable to find anything related to the military that looks like what I saw.  The closest object I found was something that some guy in North Carolina posted a picture of not too long ago.  The biggest difference is that the object in his picture looked rectangular and what I saw looked very square",

She said she had never seen anything like it before. I & my stepdaughter, age 17, went outside on my south facing 2nd floor porch. I'd say we were outside by 7:10 pm. At first we didn't see anything. There was the sound of a plane going over but not extremely loud & that soon passed. Approximately 5 min after we went out, my stepdaughter saw first, then I saw, 3 or 4 clear, bright, orange round balls of light in a cluster. They were at around 45¬∞ and in the southeast direction. They seemed close, though I'm unable to give any estimate of distance. They suddenly appeared and after no more than 5 seconds had all disappeared again. They seemed to disappear sequentially, not all at once. No sounds at all were heard at this time. I thought possibly flares, but, like I said, there was no ! sound of any planes or helicopters in the sky. And also, these seemed to be not far from me, in a very populated residential area. Why would anyone be dropping flares in such an area? We waited but didn't see any more balls of light. However, about 5 minutes later, we both saw just inside the bottom of a low cloud an oval appearing white light, much larger than the orange lights. It flashed on just once, for a few seconds, that we saw. It was mild with patchy clouds & light breeze that night. Although it has rained earlier in the day, there were no storms or lightning in the area. It made us wonder if the small orange lights could have been dropped from whatever the oval white light represented. I've never seen anything resembling this before.",

     "text":"Detailed sighting of a black rectangular craft with circles on the bottom.  Seen traveling then vanished! As a lifelong lover of space, weather, aviation craft etc.  from a young age I have always found myself staring up to the sky.  I mean compulsively.  Whenever I step outside, I always check the full skyline for sun, moon, stars, storms, aircraft ...anything.  Also as an Engineer I‚Äôve always believed that advanced technologies do or have existed. Despite all this and in 40 years of living I‚Äôve never seen anything unexplainable in the skies.  This changed on Oct 31st 2019.  I prepped the kids for Trick or Treating then went outside on our north facing deck of my home in the middle of a populated area.  Immediately I noticed a black object sitting in the sky maybe a mile or two to the north.  At the same time I heard the sound of a small prop plane, and at first I thought this propeller sound was coming from the black object and that the black  object was just a typical aircraft.  But I then noticed a small, much closer, very slow flying Cessna traveling west to east above I-94 that was clearly making the sound I heard.  It was just getting to dusk as I remember the Cessna‚Äôs flashing lights were on and I could just still see its paint color.  I refocused back on the black object and my heart started to race a bit as it looked unusual and rectangular.  Seconds later it started flying towards me, but at 45 degree angle from straight at me.  I now could clearly see it was indeed a black colored rectangle (geometric prism) or aka brick shape.  It moved with the wider dimension out to its sides (not lengthwise).  The object then moved by jumping(?) forward and started now to the ESE direction, I rubbed my eyes   as I could not believe it and also it seemed it could blur out of focus.  Overall, I got some very clear looks at this object and it was an definitely an engineered flying craft unlike anything I‚Äôve ever seen! There were two larger white circles at each end and about 4 smaller white circles all in-line with the larger two circles across the width of the rectangle.  There were no flashing lights and these larger circles weren‚Äôt lights it appeared, but looked maybe half spheres recessed into the craft like ceiling can lights or something...I don‚Äôt know.  They were white, but very soft and hazy, not bright at all.  The object was really messing with my mind and senses.  It had: zero sound, moved supernaturally smooth (it appeared it could also sort of jump forward in space, unlike typically high speed acceleration) , extremely poor aerodynamics (like a wide brick like geometry),  came in and out of focus (optical cloaking?),  and not sure if I was panicking but I felt like it saw me watching it. Finally, it flew fast well out in front of the Cessna in the sky and as soon as I reached for my phone it completely disappeared!  This all lasted I think about 15 seconds.  I‚Äôve been obsessed since then and have read extensively through the NUFORC archives of rectangular craft.  I also have performed google image searches and have found some very similar pictures and descriptions.  Ive created a detailed drawing using MSPowerpoint  It was certainly larger than the Cessna, and was pretty dang big, but not humongous- maybe 180ft width or ‚Äúwingspan‚Äù if you will.  Also, due to its direction change from the N to ESE I also saw its depth and height (side profile) very well and it was much smaller maybe 20ft depth x15 ft high,  hard to say for sure.   So, clearly, dimensionally it strangely was just a 3D rectangle - no protruding tail, wings or features other than the circles on the bottom.  I strongly believe the Cessna could‚Äôve easily seen this object as it was maybe just several hundred feet higher in elevation and zoomed out ahead of the Cessna or just to the pilot‚Äôs front-left.  This was no toy drone and should not have been able to move like this.  My belief is the two larger, white, half-spheres have something significant to do with its power/propulsion as when its direction changed one of these circles haziness was more prominent  I‚Äôve replayed this sighting over and over in my head and I‚Äôm confident in all these descriptions of what I saw.  I would have submitted my story sooner, but wanted to do my research and was unsure what I should do.",

I was in the back yard of my brother's property next door, facing south, talking to my brother who was to the east side of the property. I turned to talk to him and when I did, looked up at the trees that separate the property. I noticed an object that I would describe as looking like a pill type capsule or cigar shape. This object was bright white and obviously reflecting the setting sun. it had no noise nor did it have a contrail like conventional aircraft. It moved at a steady pace in a north south direction. There were a few clouds but, they were to the south and as the object moved off, you could still see it reflecting the light while in the clouds. I would estimate it roughly at around 7,000 ft. altitude. When I first saw it, it looked to be about 3 inches long from my vantage point on the ground. As I said, it appeared first as a cigar shape but, as it went away, it appeared as a round shape as would be expected by something of that shape moving away from you. I am a former volunteer fire fighter and a trained weather spotter so, I am familiar with the skies. I grew up near an airport and had a father who was crazy about airplanes so, I am familiar with all types of conventional aircraft. My brother did not see it at first when I pointed it out to him due to the trees but, did see it long enough to file a report also. ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected by source of report.  PD))",

     "text":"A tiny white elliptical object, illuminated by the sun at -6 magnitude at first, was observed 20¬∞ upper left of Venus at dusk. I am a PhD former chemistry professor, age 56, avid amateur astronomer since age 13 who knows the night sky and where and when planets are visible and can recognize constellations even from a few stars.  Other witnesses include both of my children (experienced sky observers‚Äîson has seen other UFOs of different shapes recently; I have not) and several teenage and adult friends of my daughter present at the youth rodeo event we were all attending Monday evening. I had brought my 7x50 mm binoculars to better see events and to check to see if I could tell what phase Venus was in, and if I could see any of Jupiter‚Äôs moons. Sunset was at 8:53 pm, and I started to look for Venus to the west right afterward.  A couple of minutes before 9 pm, I saw what I thought was Venus much higher (about 40¬∞ altitude) and further south than expected.  It also seemed much too bright, maybe magnitude -5.5 or even -6. I looked at this strange ‚ÄòVenus‚Äô through the binoculars and found not the partly illuminated planet, barely resolved at the low magnification I was using, but instead an elliptical bright white object in its place. (I would later compare the object‚Äôs horizontal dimension with the spread of Jupiter‚Äôs moons, and found the object to be slightly broader). The object‚Äôs long dimension was horizontal, and the right side had a brilliant white glint that always remained the brightest as high-altitude sunset progressed and the object began to turn yellow, then orange. I found the real Venus about 20¬∞ to the lower right of this object‚Äôs position a little after 9 pm, and Jupiter about 40¬∞ to the object‚Äôs left, about the same altitude as the object above the horizon about 9:10 pm. I discerned no net movement of the object as Venus got lower after sunset, but it did start to take on a distinctly yellowish hue about 9:10 pm, then much more orange at about 9:14-15. It had also faded to about the same magnitude as Venus by then (-4.3 or so).  It rapidly faded from naked eye sight at 9:17 pm, presumably from the sun setting at its rather substantial altitude. The sighting was not over, though, as I was able to find the object, probably +4 magnitude in the still dusk-illuminated western sky with my binoculars.  It was now brownish-gray, only slightly brighter than the sky behind it, but now the right brightest spot had a faint pure white light that reminded me of a white LED.  At random intervals I noticed very faint white sparkles as if other white LED lights were flashing on and off all over the now rather non-descript ellipse.  The slightly mottled appearance it had when most brightly illuminated by the sun, with the very close odd dark halo on the left, was no longer apparent. I was able to find it fairly easily over and over despite not being able to see it with my naked eye because it stayed in the same exact spot where I had seen it, neither moving with the wind, nor moving with the night sky.  The last time I saw it was close to 10 pm, and it seemed much smaller and fainter at that point, but still hovering in the same spot with the faint white light on the right side still going on and off, but now almost too faint to see.   Object overall magnitude was about +6 or fainter at that point, and only its larger size compared to the pinpoint stars could distinguish it from them.  I tried to find it again after 10 pm, but was unsuccessful.  I tried to find it again at the same time period of 21:00 to 21:30 on Tuesday August 7th, but I saw nothing out of the ordinary, under almost identical observing conditions. Sky conditions were cloudless with some smoke from distant fires visible near the horizon. I was downtown in southeastern Buhl at the rodeo grounds, and there were a lot of bright lights both in the arena and the spectator areas, so my nighttime vision wasn‚Äôt fully dark-adapted.  So light pollution was a problem, but not terribly so as the arena was to the east and the object was to the west south west.  My son confirmed the shape and overall appearance of the UFO. I considered the possibility that it was a weather balloon, but long dimension is usually vertical with the real ones I‚Äôve seen in the past, and the slight prevailing westerly wind should have moved it from its starting point to much closer or even overhead.  I concede the balloon explanation may fit, but too many strange aspects just didn‚Äôt fit a mere weather balloon, hence my willingness to make this report. The fact that the object remained illuminated by the sun for 24 additional minutes after local sunset should prove useful in determining its altitude, despite it being about 40¬∞ above the western horizon rather than overhead‚ÄîI was very careful to note the exact time it started to rapidly fade from naked eye visibility.  I personally don‚Äôt know to calculate the UFO‚Äôs altitude from these observations, but I suspect it was over ten miles up at minimum. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to establish whether the object might have been a high-altitude balloon.  PD))",

Immediately after emerging from the Boston tunnels, headed Westbound on I-90, I saw a constant stationary illumination, circular and white, directly ahead of us.  Too large and too early in the day to be a star, I pointed it out to my husband, who was driving.  We joked about it, but I kept watching.  Heading due-west, I realized it was moving North and South, but there was no smoke trail.  As soon as I opened my mouth to mention it to my husband, he exclaimed, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs moving!‚Äù  Very soon after, it seemed to stop moving North-South, but the light got smaller and smaller until it disappeared from sight. Minutes later, we were passing over a body of water by a Framingham exit.  The reflection looked orange, so I looked up, expecting to see sunset starting.  Instead, the sky was bright blue and clear of clouds, except for one, which was directly ahead of us.  It was neon orange in color, a vertical ellipse in shape, about 40 azimuth from the horizon, about 10 azimuth in height.  I joked in less technical terms that it looked like female genitalia. I do a lot of sky gazing, I‚Äôve never seen a cloud like this, my jaw was in my chest, eyes trained on it.  I remarked that it looked like it was glowing brighter, and the constantly white UFO reappeared at the very top of the elliptical cloud, growing from pinpoint in size to the same size as we had originally seen it.  The cloud dissipated within seconds, from the top down, looking more purple as it dissipated.  There was a bright white flash at the very top of the UFO, and a few seconds later it seemed to momentarily change from white to a faint green, but I don‚Äôt remember if this was before or after the cloud dissipated. It was difficult to gauge if the UFO was moving or hovering after that, due to the winding roads. It fell out of sight a few times when we dropped in altitude, (particularly Westbound on I/84). The diameter of the illumination was consistent until we neared the Hartford, Connecticut area, when it seemed to grow larger, and appeared to be hovering South of Hartford. We lost sight of it when we exited in New Britain, Connecticut, and we couldn‚Äôt see it at our final destination.",

Description:  I had just started my morning commute to work and was by road about three miles from home which is located in Paradise Park (that‚Äôs on about any recent topographic map of the area).   The sun had just broken the higher peaks visible from the canyon bottom as I noticed a glint toward the top of the windshield.  I slowed to take a closer look as the sky was beautifully blue and clear and there should have been nothing in that area of sky.  I‚Äôve driven this route for over 10 years and know it well.   What I saw was an ellipsoidal object lit from beneath by the sun.  It was slowly and noiselessly moving toward the west at, I would estimate, about 10 mph.  It was moving level and in a linear manner.   My first thought was a weather balloon; yea, sure, Uncle.  If so, it would be moving against any prevailing breeze which would be from the west to east.  There was no breeze at ground level that morning.    It did not change shape or direction.   I had it in view for about three to four seconds and watched it move behind an unnamed \"hill\" which is a small but quite obvious peak from the bottom of the canyon.  On the topographic map the hill is noted at 6897‚Äô in elevation at the top.  I would estimate the object was just below the peak and travelled just south of the peak as the ellipse disappeared \"behind\" the peak from the canyon bottom and road.    Based on the spruce trees on the peak, I would estimate the major axis of the ellipse which was horizontal to be about 25‚Äô to 30‚Äô and the minor axis to be about 1/3 that.  It was clearly lit from below by the early morning sun and appeared the white \"color\" of the sun, a highly reflective surface which added no spectral modification of its own.  It was totally opaque.   The linear distance from the road, my observation point, to the object was about 0.20 miles.  This is estimated from the topographic map of the area.  If I had been home and looking out the south-facing windows of the house, I would have been looking down on the object and had a much longer sighting Too bad!   Just for interest sake, this was by far not my first sighting nor, hopefully, will be my last.  It is the first I have reported to NUFORC.   I am ((50's-60's)) years old, am a practicing ((deleted))engineer, and have a degree in ((deleted--a science)).  Interests are amateur radio, optical and radio astronomy, general relativity, mineralogy and geology, UFOology, and \"pushing the limits\" of electromagnetics.   I presently work as an ((deleted--large, technical company)) in the Denver, Colorado area.  This is all to imply I consider myself a credible witness.",

     "text":"Three spherical orange objects in cluster at treeline then moving farther away and erratically moving while viewing over Lake Marion. We live on Lake Marion in the city of Cross, South Carolina. While sitting in a glass sunroom approximately 15 x 30 surrounded by glass viewing the water and a small island in front of us as I looked over my friends head noticed 3 glowing orange lights at approximately  8:15 p.m. just above the tree line. I then asked her to look at which time we both stepped to the glass pain opened the window and witnessed the following together.  Three (3) soft glowing orange lights appeared over the tree line of the island.  Trees are approximately 30-40 foot tall.  The lights were pulsating between each other.  They were close enough to reflect light off of the water below and within 100 ft of where we were standing in the room.  The episode was completely silent. This position lasted approximately five (5) minutes with them taking turns ascending and descending while hovering at the tree line.  Then all three of them lined up in unison ascended across the tree line and quickly shot into the sky at a 9 o'clock 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock direction.  They ascended high enough to appear like airplanes and shot back and forth in a chaotic flight pattern at which time joining with numerous other lights we saw that were also in an erratic flight pattern.  This continued for approximately a total of twenty (20) minutes. As of now we are still witnessing an orange flashing light in the distance  9:11 p.m. with a fast flashing light hovering and moving erratically. It is not getting higher, lower, or otherwise it is just jerking around in the sky.  At 9:31 p.m. still viewing one that continues to move in a somewhat circular motion then ascending and descending with an orange glow. To the best of our ability we did take videos as well as still images.  When the images are zoomed it the object appears to be square in some of the images.  In the videos it appears as a light source clearing moving erratically.  We continue to witness the last object as of 10:54 p.m. We live on the lake and view the night sky from our sunroom on a nightly basis.  This is the first time we have witnessed such a sighting.  We do have photos and videos on our cell phone whereas we increased the picture size and video to the largest format.  We will gladly submit upon request.",

On July 3, 2010, 9:15 PM, I was in my back yard, between the barn and the house.  I have four bats that come out at night and was watching them eating insects.  Something caught my eye and it looked like it might be a half mile up in the sky. The object was not exactly oval shaped, but not really cigar shaped, but rather like a capsule. The back half was lit, but not with a light bulb.  The middle section was dark, and the front was identical to the back half lit, more glowing.  There was no sound, no wings, no gondola, and it appeared to be moving as if by equipment, and not the wind. I watched for approximately 4 minutes.  This object was going from approximately north to south. It disappeared by just going away in the distance. Also, it the light was not brought on by the sunset, as the sun was already down for the night. To give an estimate of how large this object may have been if on the ground it is hard to say, but my estimate would probably be in the 25-30 feet range, the height maybe 8 feet or so.  My neighbor asked me, when I told him of this, wanted to know if there were any smaller lights on it, such as what airplanes use, and there were not.",

     "text":"Group of bright lights maneuvering at very high speed Date:  15 July 2009   Location:  3 Miles South of Greencastle, PA   Time:  5:30 AM (exactly)   Lighting Conditions:  Generally dark with a hint of dawn on the extreme eastern horizon.  There was a large, bright half-moon that was very high in the sky (~80 degrees of azimuth) to the Southeast; several bright stars were visible although most were obscured by scattered high-level cloud cover. Weather:  Generally clear skies with very light clouds between 20,000-30,000 feet and a second layer of scattered clouds higher up (~50,000-60,000 feet).  There was no significant wind at ground level but the scattered clouds above were moving briskly towards the southeast. Other Aircraft Visible:  A large commercial jetliner (737,757, 767 scale) was visible at a bearing of about 120 degrees true at an estimated 35,000-45,000 feet in elevation.  The aircraft‚Äôs structure and contrails were visible to the eye as were the white strobe warning light and red & green running lights. Observers Background:  I am a retired Navy Commander who served in the Navy for 21 years on both submarines and surface combatants.  I have been involved in both nuclear power and nuclear weapons and maintained security clearances above the TOP SECRET level.  My most senior assignments were at Fleet Forces Command (U.S. Atlantic Fleet HQ) NAVSUPSYSCOM as Director of Supply Chain Management for all Navy and Marine Corps conventional ammunition. My educational background is in chemical, mechanical and petroleum engineering and I hold a Masters in Business Administration.  Currently I work as General Manager for an industrial manufacturing company.  I have excellent vision, am taking no medications, have never had delusions or mental illness and am not a stereotypical \"UFO fanatic.\"  I have a significant knowledge regarding aircraft available in the current military inventory and have observed aircraft exceeding mock 1 in relatively close proximity.  I have observed a night-time launch of the space shuttle when my submarine was in Port Canaveral, FL.  I have not observed a definitive UFO or made a UFO sighting report previously. Sequence of Events:  Initial Observation:  I existed my front door at exactly 5:30 AM to start a typical 5-mile walk.  I always check my watch to verify my start time.  It was still fairly dark outside with only a faint hint of sunrise on the extreme eastern horizon.  I immediately noticed a very bright group of lights to the southeast at approximately 140-degrees true and about 10-degrees above the tree- line.  These lights caught my attention because I had never seen anything like them before as they were extremely bright.  To my naked eye, they appeared as three glowing balls that were close together or perhaps touching.  At first I though I must be seeing the moon through clouds but as I glanced up I could see a very bright half-moon well above and to the left of the object.  I also noticed several stars were out and that there was a large commercial jet at about 100-degrees true and very high up (~35,000-40,000 feet) that was traveling east-to-west.  As I glanced back at the three lights I observed that they had traveled a significant distance in just a few seconds and seemed to be moving at great speed.  I couldn‚Äôt see any typical aircraft lights (white strobe or red/green running lights) and had a gut feeling that this was an unusual event.  I bolted into my house to get a pair of binoculars.  This initial observation took 5-7 seconds. Second Observation:  I had a pair of 10 power binoculars readily available for an upcoming hunting trip and it took me no more than 10 seconds to retrieve them and return to my front porch.  I relocated the object in the sky at about 190- degrees true, about 15 seconds after first seeing the object.  Obviously it had moved from the southeast horizon to southwest very quickly.  I observed that it was about 25,000 feet in altitude ‚Ä¶ about the same height as a few light clouds that were close by the object.  I also estimated it was 2-3 miles to the south from me horizontally.  As soon as I looked at the object in 10-power, it was clear there were 6 distinct bright lights.  I looked hard for any visible structures (wings, fuselage, etc.) but saw nothing, nor could I see any typical aircraft lights (white strobe or red/green running lights).  The lights were circular and arranged in a symmetrical pattern of a circle or an imaginary hexagon with each light being centered over each of the corners (see diagram).  The lights were all the same size and color (white & yellow) and were moving together.  It could have been six objects moving in formation but my impression was that the lights were located on a single object. Not seeing any distinguishing features, I put down the binoculars as I wanted to try to gage the size of the object using any available reference. At this point, it had been about 20 seconds since I first saw the object.  It had continued moving west and was at about 220-degrees true and still at ~25,000 feet.  I quickly estimated it had traveled about 10 miles in 20 seconds.  This computed to 30 miles per minute or 1,800 MPH.  Clearly it was moving at 2-3 times the speed of sound and confirmed my impression of extremely high velocity (I had directly observed military aircraft at supersonic speeds below 500 feet in elevation in the past ‚Ä¶ the military can do this on the open ocean just not over populated land). I then compared the object to the half-moon still to the southeast and above the object.  In comparison, the object would have covered 25% of a complete FULL MOON in size (see diagram).  It also equaled the half- moon in brightness when seen with the naked eye. I also remembered the large commercial jetliner to the southeast and thought to compare size with this as well.  The jetliner was still plodding along at 500MPH or so and had moved about 10 degrees to 130-degrees true.  I could see the jet‚Äôs structure clearly and estimated that the diameter of the object with 6-lights was approximately 2.5-3 jet-lengths or 250-300 yards across--obviously very large. I had a thought that perhaps I was seeing the international space station or Hubble telescope and that I was catching a reflection off of solar collection panels as sunrise hit one of these orbiting structures. Final observation:  I had been observing the object for about a total of 30-35 seconds at this point when the object came to a rapid stop, or at least stopped moving west.  I then looked through the binoculars again and picked up the 6 distinct lights in view.  After 2-3 seconds all 6 lights rotated about 30- degrees to the left, like a door knob that was being turned.  The object then began to climb vertically--it was no longer moving west, just up, straight up.  I also observed that there were definitely clouds above the object telling me that it was not in fact in orbit around the Earth but in fact in our atmosphere and between cloud layers.  It appeared the object was accelerating quickly, as within 4-5 seconds it looked to have shrunk to less than half it‚Äôs original size.  Within another 3-4 seconds I observed it breaking through the upper cloud layer and it immediately shrank from view. Comments:  The total observation period was about 50 seconds with a 10-second break while I retrieved the binoculars. I did not hear any sound from the object (like a sonic boom) but I also did not hear the commercial jet when it passed overhead about 2 minutes later.  One possible explanation is that higher level winds were moving briskly to the southeast and taking acoustic energy away from me.  Also, there was a loud freight train about a mile away that was generating a significant volume of low frequency rumbling masking noise. This object was definitely moving at a high rate of speed, appeared to be substantially larger than man-made aircraft and was maneuvering.  It moved from the eastern horizon to the western horizon in about 25 seconds and then straight up and out of site within another 10-15 seconds.  Initially, it was somewhat below the commercial jet (also moving west) but the object was moving much faster.  It took the jet 2-2.5 minutes to traverse the same distance that the object traversed in ~25 seconds. The brightness of the 6-lights was so intense that it was impossible to see structural details beyond the glare. The object was definitely between cloud layers and not in orbit around the Earth.",

     "text":"Strange object hovering over the city. UFO SIGHTING July 25, 2008   8:15 p.m. P.S.T San Fernando Valley, CA  My friend and I were in transit when the sighting occurred. He was driving and I was seated in the passenger seat. We were in the southeast area of the valley in the city of Van Nuys. We were traveling southbound on White Oak Avenue when my friend pointed out a strange object in the sky directly in front of us. Before I proceed to delve into more detail about the sighting, I must emphasize that my friend and I are considered amongst our peers to be quite argumentative and skeptical when any topic of conversation broaches or offends our strong beliefs in logic and reason. Both of us are avid readers of scientific non-fiction and I am currently obtaining my Bachelor degree in science. So, neither one of us are prone to the unquestioned acceptance of fanciful tales of a pseudo-scientific nature. I live next to an airport and therefore bear witness to a never ending flow of air traffic of all forms of commercial, private, and military aircraft. This object was quite obviously not an airplane or helicopter. This object was in the shape of an ellipse and was a dull gray color. Aside from the complete lack of any wings or propellers, the attribute that was the most immediately startling and indicative of the object‚Äôs unconventional design was the array of multi-colored lights evenly distributed about the circumference of the object‚Äôs surface. On each side, there was a blinking red light. The rest of the lights appeared to flicker through the color spectrum. The distance of the object was difficult to judge because there was no way to discern how large the object was. However, it was either close enough to us or large enough at a distance that we could easily see the edges of the object against the sky. This was not just a cluster of blurry glowing dots. We turned left on Vanowen St. and began heading east at which point the surrounding buildings, which had been intermittently obscuring our view, gave way to a wide open field which gave me an uninterrupted period of approximately five minutes to study the object in the sky. This object did not change or vary its position in the slightest. Even after our trajectory had changed, its position in the sky did not. Eventually, the cityscape completely obscured our vision of the object. We were unable to capture a photograph for lack of a camera. However, I have included a sketch of the object drawn immediately after the sighting. Hopefully, someone else has seen this object and can shed some light although I hold no illusions about the likelihood of ever having any form of answer concerning this disconcerting experience.",

     "text":"Circle of blue lights On the evening of April 17, 2007 I went out onto my front yard for a smoke before bed.  It was about 9.55 p.m. PST.  My house faces NNE.  The planes approaching Orange County Airport approach my house from the NNE and go past North to my left to the NW to land at OC approximately 8-9 miles away.  Normally I can see the planes unaided and hear them as they descend. This night was overcast so I could hear some but not see them as they broke cloud cover once they had passed my house.  As I was standing on my driveway, I saw some blue light aloft to the North moving back and forth, almost flittering like a moth.  I initally thought it was a police helicopter.  This is a well populated suburb community and it's not unusual to see one of those things circling around.  What I thought was unusual was that it was moving more in a quick back and forth movement instead of what is usually seen as a slow circle.  Also, I could not see a strong search light or hear an engine sound.  It appeared that the object was 1-2 miles away.  I thought this was odd so I retrieved a pair of quality 20x binoculars that I keep hanging on a coat rack inside the front door.  What I saw raised the hair on the back of my neck.  These lights seemed to consist of a row of individual blue lights that first were traveling to the left.  As the object reversed direction, the object appeared to be first an ellipse and then a full circle that had maybe 24-30 individual blue lights around the perimeter.  It then traveled to the right and reversed the process again forming a circle at the end of its travel when reversing direction.  Its travel in each direction was maybe 3-5 seconds.  There were definitely no red/green port/starboard lights, only the blue perimeter lights and no strobe lights.  I watched this object for 2-3 minutes and I believe it was out there longer than that since I noticed it there soon after I initially stepped outside.  It finally disappeared into the cloud cover.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would come back but it was gone.  I don't have a working video camera and probably would not have had time to get it if I had.  I don't really want my name associated with this.  I'm a 55 year old engineer and I've never really believed that something like this could not be identified, but I have never seen anything like this.  I used to fly small aircraft so I have some experience with the shapes and types of various small planes.  BTW, the only thing I drank that night was a cup of tea and a glass of Metamucil so I was completely aware of what was happening.  If you would like to contact me, please respond to my e-mail address.  If you would like to speak to me, let me know and I'll call you, or respond to you with a phone number to reach me.  What I would find crazy about this is if no one else saw it.  As said, although the community is quiet and most people are in bed or in home at that hour, there are enough people around here that someone else should have seen this to collaborate.  If you would to contact be, do so at the e-mail listed in witness information.

At 3:16 to 3:17 AM, I went outside before going to bed, and within a moment I noticed the sky was clear and saw what I thought were airplane lights moving in the sky.  I then noticed there was an oval or ellipse shape formed by what looked to be 5 or more lights moving through the sky.  The size of the lights were like small, not particularly brilliant stars, but bright enough that their movement against a dark clear sky were apparent.  There could have been more than 5 stars but with the small size and distance and movement I was only able to count 5. This movement caught my attention immediately. I saw the movement was slow and steady. I went quickly into the house and shouted to my brother to come immediately.  He came out and also watched the object. The Pleiades were to the south of this object and higher in the sky than the object.  The object moved on a track toward the northeast horizon.  If I were to draw a line to track its trajectory backward, if it had traveled a straight line; then it started west and to the mid heaven side of the Pleiades. There was a notable gut sense the object was very large and quite a distance away, higher in the sky than perhaps one might think.  But, there was no visual reference to verify this sense. We are in Southeast Iowa in a small town of 8000.  If there were no city lights we would have had a better view. We watched to see if any star lights were obscured by its passing over them, but the lights of the object became dimmer as it traveled closer to the horizon was such that we never saw any stars crossed and we lost view of the object before it got low enough in the sky to have its view blocked by the trees. I thought of calling the police to report this, it being so unusual; then decided not to bother as the object had passed.  I reported this sighting to my ex-wife and a friend by email so that I would have a time stamp to record the time; then thought to look on the net to see if other had seen an object like this. So far I have not seen a picture which matches what we saw, but only looked on the net for a couple minutes. We are occasional sky watchers by habit when we go outside on occasion, and have many a time observed satellites on occasion. This was new and different. The low side of the ellipse was on the left, on the north side, rising to the right (south) as in the picture below. No sound was heard. I am 55 and my brother is 49.  We were not under the influence of any drug, but we did have a half beer each about 7 hours earlier, which surely did not cause this strange observation.  Quite interesting.

I was returning home from Arizona the evening of August 17, 2018, about 7:40PM PDT.  I was driving north on I-11 (US93-95) and had just passed the Boulder City interchange when I noticed a brilliant light, WNW of my position about 35 degrees above the horizon.  The light appeared to be approaching Black Mountain but was off in the distance, seemingly 10-20 miles away.   I immediately assumed that it was simply a jet on final into McCarran airport, since the jet traffic routinely make their final turns at Black Mountain.  I glanced at it again about 30 seconds later and noticed that it hadn‚Äôt moved in any closer.  Right then the light started to shimmer to a dull orange and went completely black and became a rectangular shaped black object, silhouetted against the dusk sky.  Though the overall object appeared quite small (maybe 1/6 of a full moon) the corners of the rectangle were sharply defined.   I glanced back at it again periodically every few seconds while ! driving and noticed after another 30 seconds a milky tail start to come out of the black rectangular object and cover it in mist.  Five seconds after that it had completely disappeared between my glances at it.  No mist just gone.  I would have assumed it was a meteor viewed face on, had it not been visible for almost 2 minutes in total.",

     "text":"A small white sphere that could descend to ground level in seconds where at which time it would begin to glow red and not white. I was the only witness to this event and therefor can only give information about myself.  I am thirty-nine years old and have spent a great deal of time outside and looking to the sky.  Most of my life, I have worked in kitchens and bakeries but I am currently taking classes at the community college.  I hope to earn my associates in science and hopefully transfer to our local four year to study ecology.  I make the same walk often and have never seen anything like this before this time, nor have I since this event. I believe that this event occurred somewhere between 1:30 and 2:00 Sunday morning.  I was walking through the neighborhood on my way home and noticed a star that looked out of place.  When I was able to find a break in both the branches of the trees above and the clouds then I was able to be certain that this was not a star.  It began to glow more brightly and then made some quick movements with angles that would form a triangle.  Once I knew that I was actually seeing something that was out of place I kept the object in sight and continued my walk home. With the craft in sight and well above the level of any clouds, I noticed that the white light that was coming from the craft was getting brighter and realized that it was descending very quickly and moving straight toward me.  In only a matter of seconds it was at the level of the street lamps, and I was now able to see that the craft was a sphere roughly the size of a basketball.  It was no longer emitting white light but had begun to glow red.  The red lights on this craft seemed to move in sort of a rubics cube manner and then it began to ascend back to about cloud level.   I walked the last about six blocks to my home with this craft not following me but staying within sight and almost leading me to my home. During this time the craft descended to within thirty to forty feet of me two more times.   Each time emitting white light when high up in the sky and glowing red when at street level.  The lights were broken up and moving rapidly on the outside of the craft and it sometimes appeared that there was no solid object but more of an organization of tiny lights moving in a cooperative manner through the air.  I was turning onto my street where I live at the fourth house down and was surprised at how un afraid I had been through the first two descents.  The craft then came down to within eight feet of the ground and still moving ahead of me, it went past and around to the other side of my neighbor‚Äôs house.  This last descent was when I first really got my anxiety up and being relieved to be at my house I went inside and tried to wrap my head around what I had just seen. Once inside my home I noticed a wound on my hand that looked like someone took a tiny spoon and scooped out a tiny bit of my hand.  There was no bleeding, it just was already grown over with a very smooth concave scab.  I am pretty certain that I did not have such a wound when I left my last destination to head towards my house.  The next day I also had what felt like a sunburn on my face.  When I looked in the mirror my face appeared red but unlike a sunburn it this burn was evenly spread throughout every part of my face.  Even under my nose and in the creases around my nose that are rarely hit by the sun was burned.  This burn lasted about a day and a half before I began peeling and within a day or so my face had peeled completely.  I am certain I was not burned by the sun.  I suspect that the craft was burning my skin when it was emitting the white light.  My face was the only part of me that was exposed and when the craft was at cloud level the white light seemed to foc! us right on my face as I looked directly back at the source.  There was no visible beam of light, but I could see and feel this light much more than the glowing red light that would be seen when the craft was at street level. The basic description of this object would be a bright white light when high in the sky and a formation of small red lights when at a level where it could be seen easily.    It could make this type of altitude change in barely over a second and during the first two descents the mass of the object hovered completely still while the red lights rotated around a central mass. very rapidly.   It made no sound and was almost the size of a basketball.   The third descent was the only time I saw the craft move in any direction other than up or down while near the ground.  The red lights would move rapidly almost as if they were being worked very quickly in the same manner a rubic‚Äôs cube would be solved only spherical and with thousands of tiny red lights instead of the 54 panels one would find on the standard rubic‚Äôs cube.  The object moved slowly as it went around towards the back of my neighbor‚Äôs house.  As it hovered across my neighbor‚Äôs house it maintained a height just below th! e level of the first-floor gutters on the house. It seemed to glow more of a golden or white glow that would overpower the red lights and then fade back to a low enough level that the red lights could be seen once again. I was trying to post about this shortly after the event but I had a lot of trouble using my keypad to form the words that I had intended on typing.  This continued for until I had slept a full night‚Äôs sleep.  It felt as if my mind was partially disabled for a bit of time after seeing this object.",

To Whom it May Concern:  I am writing you to file a UFO sighting report that is long overdue. Ive always had a great interest in the UFO phenomenon but never actually had a sighting of my own.  Not one that I was 100% certain about anyway.  I really wasnt aware that MUFON had such a widespread network until recently, and I really hadnt considered how important it is for individuals to report such sightings so the data can be documented until now.   This occured sometime in the summer of 2006. Im estimating it was around August of that year.  I was at a friends house in Barnesville, Pa which is approximately an hours travel (by automobile) South of Scranton, Pa.  We actually had a small 3 piece band at the time and were practicing late at night in his home studio.  This location was ideal for late night rehersals due to the lack of any really close neighbors.  There arent any street lamps near the area, or at least at that time there werent.  So the night sky was awe inspiring.  I was always taken back when I was there at night because all the stars were so visible with no light pollution. Anyway, we decided to take a short break and I stepped outside the front door onto the porch area for a ciggarette.  I stepped out from under the roof a few steps and just as a began to look upwards I noticed a streak of light enter my perifreal vision from my left.  As I looked upward it stopped suddenly and abruptly, going from an extremely high rate of speed, to a dead stop in an instant.  It was directly overhead at an altitude I'd have to guess would be maybe 1500 -2000 feet.  At that altitude the object was slightly larger than my thumbnail held at arms length looking upward at the sky. I'd always expected, if I ever was to have a UFO sighting, to see a disc shaped craft.  Well, this was not disc shaped.  It looked more \"egg\" shaped.  Almost as if you were to take a Tylenol capsule and hold it in the air.  The division of its coloration was also the same.  The rear half was green and the front half was red.  Divided 50/50.  Both the front and rear of this object seemed to \"counter\" rotate. I got this impression because there was a dry ice like vapor lingering around the rear (greenish) part of the object as it hovered.  The entire length of time it hovered was about 3 seconds or less and seemed to \"bobble\" ever so slightly during this time.  I just had registered the thought of yelling for my other friend just inside when it zipped off over the horizon to my right.  I just began to get the first uttering of words from my mouth when this happened.  What I was trying to say was \"Man, you are not gunna believe this.\"  But I never quite got it out.  By the time my friend got outside it was long gone. I know absolutely what I saw without any doubt. I've been an artist and a musician my entire life and pay great attention to subtle details commonly overlooked. I guess you can say a photographic memory to an extent. I hope this report and it's documentation helps you in some way. I've always been curious to know if there are other reports like mine, with the same type of description. I myself, haven't heard many. If you have any information you can forward me of similar sightings in the area I'd be excited to check it out. I appreciate your time in reading my report and greatly appreciate the work you and your collegues do on a day to day basis. If I can be of ANY assistance to you or your cause, please don't hesitate to contact me either by Email or phone.  Sincerely, ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

My oldest son had just started driving.  As a precaution, I placed an app on his cell phone that would allow me to ping his location and trace him if needed.  Just for fun, my 13 year old son and I decided to test it on the way home... just to see where he was at.  We traced him to a neighborhood about 2 miles from the house, where he was visiting friends.  We honked and waved at him as we passed him sitting in his truck.  We stopped at a stop sign in this very populated neighborhood.  While stopped, a bright green (almost lime green neon) cylinder/capsule shaped object appeared high in the sky.  This object was not moving.  It was just hovering.  After about 5 seconds... it started to move very slowly and then suddenly it flew at a phenomenal speed and suddenly disappeared.  My son looked at me and said, \"Dad... did you see that?\"  I immediately called my oldest son to see if he or any of his friends saw it.  They didn't.  I checked the news for t! he next week, and even surfed the net.  Nothing was ever mentioned about anything.  This was only 30 minutes from the largest city in Alabama.  There is no way that we were the only people to see this.  It was not a man made craft.  The only possible thing I believe it could have been (if not alien) is a projected laser in sky.  We aren't crazy and we don't stare at the sky looking for UFOs.  I had to estimate the date, but I know it was summer of 2012 and just starting to turn dark.

Upon jumping out of the car the object appeared to move in our direction and seemed to flare up in brightness slightly.  It was immediately obvious this was something quite unusual and unconventional/non-ordinary.  In the distance, I noticed a small aircraft (just the lights) approach in our direction from the SW somewhat toward the object and I remember wondering if the pilot was actually seeing this object and attempting to come closer to investigate.  The orange object (upon having moved essentially overhead where we were) suddenly then traveled upwards, becoming smaller and smaller (in the clear night sky) until it simply disappeared.  Interestingly, the small aircraft seemed to veer off of its seemingly interceptive trajectory at that time and proceeded to fly almost straight north and eventually disappeared from view. We then went indoors and put everything away to settle in for the evening.  After about 15 minutes I suddenly felt the need to go back outside again and found that the object had returned over our driveway (though likely several hundred feet up‚ÄîI am a bad judge of distance, however), bright as ever.  It moved slightly and stopped a couple of times and by the time I got my housemate to come back outside again it seemed to quickly fade from view.  There were at least 3 or 4 more occasions in the next hour where I went back outside to find the object in the sky again, roughly in the same location.  I eventually stopped trying to go back outside once fog moved in to the area and obscured the sky and surroundings.  I estimate this to have been a little after 22:30 o‚Äôclock. The object made no sound, glowed with variable brightness/intensity‚Äîfrom quite brilliant to extremely dim, then brilliant again‚Äîwith no flashing lights of any kind, seemed fairly large in size (certainly larger than a Chinese lantern‚Ä¶possibly larger than a helicopter) and appeared to move slowly/deliberately and/or hover rather than exhibit accelerative speed, except when it swiftly traveled straight up and disappeared the first time.  Although we initially somehow assumed it was probably spherical in shape it at times seemed to reveal a more elongated general appearance.  The darkness of the sky and the brightness of the object made this very difficult to clearly determine.  I also couldn‚Äôt help but feel it was somehow oddly ‚Äúaware‚Äù of us standing there viewing it, as it appeared to be drawn to our location.  It seemed to make some directional movement toward me whenever I stepped outside to view it and it also seemed to flare in response to the attention and our efforts to! talk to it.  I am open to the reasonable possibility that this aspect of things may just be some sort of coincidence, however. I used my iPhone 5 to take a few quick snapshots, though the resolution (as is often the case at times like this) was fairly poor.  One picture does seem to suggest a more ‚Äúrod-shaped‚Äù form when enlarged.  I attempted a zoom shot in one that seemed to exhibit a more ‚Äúfuzzy spherical form‚Äù.  Another still seemed to resemble a ‚Äúclustered spherical form‚Äù.  I will forward these pics to you in a separate email.",

     "text":"This sighting was EXTREMELY similar to \"Endeavor\" space shuttle night time fly-by's. I have seen many UFO‚ÄôS in Yuma for quite sometime, and have been always disappointed because I never had a camera at hand until today during this sighting. I was able to instantly recognize that this was very similar if not exactly what I have seen in previous times in Yuma. They are major military bases in Yuma, and I truly believe that these bases DO withhold technology from which you will see in my video. I have seen events of the space shuttles zooming across the sky‚Äôs at night, if you have seen that happen then you can DEFINITELY compare how this event looked extremely similar. It was a bright white light that floated across the sky, catching my intention, enough to run inside and yell at my parents at the top of my lungs to come outside and witness this. I was so sure that this is what I have seen in the past multiple times, I even told them that this light would zoom away at thousands of miles an hour once it reaches the outside skirts of Yuma. This light did just that. My father said that that was the most significant part of this sighting, because I predicted or just pretty much knew it was going zoom out of sight at supersonic speeds. Earlier this year I sighted what had been supposedly the space shuttle ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äù or ‚ÄúEndeavor‚Äù. Our local Yuma Daily Sun news report gave approximate times for the sighting of the space station flying past, and me being a constant observer of our skies I had seen this space station one night thinking it was a UFO later to find out it was ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äù or ‚ÄúEndeavor‚Äù that was flying by. I saw this light two nights in a row. Both nights sighting were extremely similar to what you seen is this video I took that I am now reporting to you guys. The only difference being between this sighting and the ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äù or ‚ÄúEndeavor‚Äù sighting is this video is shot while the sky is lightly lit. The sun was up enough to see the sunset on the horizon. This UFO was bee-lining across the sky at a steady, slow , floating pace. It was about 30 seconds later after this video ended, due to lack of memory on the camera, that the light zoom off at supersonic speeds right as it reached the outskirts of Yuma County. While I was shooting the video I was stating that the flashing red light was ‚ÄúBELOW‚Äù  white light. It ‚ÄúWAS‚Äù below the white light just before I shot the video. I did not realize the flashing red light from the plane had been coming toward us almost directly and had risen above the white light which you see in the video. The only conclusion I can get out of that is either this white light was below this plane and the plane gained altitude, or this white light is just outside the atmosphere and created an optical illusion even to myself. So the white light can appear to an observer to either be below the atmosphere in the skies of Yuma County or it was moving at incredible rates outside the atmosphere and floated across the sky very similar to that of the satellite. So let‚Äôs say if this object was in space then it being its size and the brightness of it, this object must be gigantic enough to reflect the sun‚Äôs light off it to appear so large. So one way or another the size of this thing is massive , and you can compare it to the plane flying past. Because the plane was flying by is going to make it much easier for you guys to study the size of this object and the direction its going. And myself living in Yuma since day one, and can bet my bottom dollar that the flashing red light was from a Jumbo Commercial Airliner, no doubt in my mind, that plane is heading right for California. The fence you see in my back yard it going parallel with North and South. The airliner is heading west. The light is Heading NW from what I observed. Let me make this very Clear. This Object did not have supersonic speed until it reached the outskirts of Yuma. AS SOON AS IT DID it zoomed up to supersonic speeds and the lightly gradually at a somewhat fast pace got smaller and kind of dimmed smaller and smaller. A satellites light doesn‚Äôt even dim out like that. Satelites that I have seen in our skies did not move at same high speeds as this. Had the white light actually be in space. If it were then this white light would beat any satellite up there in a race hands down. And that was when the white light was just floating across the Yuma sky, so theres no telling just how fast this white light took off at the end of its descent. I watched this white light come across the sky from the deep south of Yuma, and I could bet my bottom dollar it was in Mexico‚Äôs air space before it reached Yuma. Do our space shuttles travel from South to North? From what I understand they do not. I would love it if you guys could get back to me and let me know what you guys think of this and if this helps you with your research. Thank for taking the time to read this. Thanks a billion!",

What I observed was shaped like an elongated pill, rounded at both ends, white in color with odd charcoal grey markings on the bottom 1/3 of it.  No wings, no tailfin, no landing gear, no windows, no blinking lights, no numbers, no trail behind it. It tracked in a steady speed in a north-westerly direction, silent. I only got to see it for a short time, during those precious seconds I was observing as much detail as I could. Has anyone seen this? I'd like to know, because I am a little unnerved by it.",

     "text":"Nightime visitation in Connecticut-1973; this was a probable abduction. When I was seven years old I had a terrifying experience that I kept to myself for weeks and was unable to sleep at night and refused to go my bedroom at night.  My parents had to let me fall asleep in the den with them and they would then carry me up to my room.  Upon finally talking to them about what was worrying me their reaction was almost as scary as the original event.  When I spoke of this with them they turned ghostly pale and seemed very stressed- although my mother did manage to muster out that it must have been \"just a dream.\"  One night in the summer of'73, I woke to find two small grey beings standing in my bedroom looking at me. (This was before any mention of, or description of, alien abductions had been put on T.V. or in the movies-to my knowledge at that time, anyway.)  The beings could not have been much taller than 4 feet, they had very large almond shaped black eyes, they were slender and their mouths were just slits.  One of the beings walked towards me and spoke to me telepathically. I could not move and I was clearly very fearful. I asked him if he was a Martian and he said, no, but you are right that we are from another planet.  I don‚Äôt remember much that happened after that, but I do remember looking towards the hallway (my door was open and the hall light was on), and I saw my father being carried out by several of the small beings out of the hall and down into the stairwell.  The only other memory of this event- which is slightly detached-is that I remember a different being, slightly larger but with the same large eyes, hovering over me, telling me that they wont hurt me and then forcing me to drink some white liquid that had the appearance of milk but had a horrible chemical taste. During my subsequent years I think I chose to forget this traumatic experience. But one day when I was in my late teens I was walking past a bookstore and saw a display of Whitley Streiber‚Äôs book \"Communion.\"  When I saw that  face on the cover of the book I went into a cold sweat and had a panic attack.  It took several months to get up the courage to purchase that book and read it. These memories then came back to me.  I have not pursued hypnotherapy to reveal any further truths, simply because I really don‚Äôt think I want to know-not yet anyway.  I swear to you that this really did happen.

There were also other colored lights, I definitely recall seeing red on either side of the craft.  Although, I couldn't make out the material of the UFO, I can say the craft did not have wings like a plane. The UFO came in and slowed down, I thought it was coming towards or watching me.  I could see it HOVERING back and forth as I sped down Lorraine Street towards it.  I then turned down the radio and rolled down the windows as it begins to rock back and forth then continues on north bound.  Very, very low flying and NO sound that I could hear.  There is no doubt it was not a plane and definitely not commercial, might it have been a drone?  It was small about 10¬≠20 ft in diameter at the biggest, I believe it seemed small light weight because the way it hovered. I got a really good idea of how it turned and maneuvered. Of course, this was the first and only night I can remember being without my phone! Almost as if the spacecraft knew I couldn‚Äôt film it!  I proceed to see more and if it wasn't a threat. However, it didn't let me get to close before zipping away. The craft seemed to me to be surveying, or doing surveillance in the neighborhood perhaps looking for something?  Or only letting me getting a juicy view!  I saw the object for about 20 seconds, so I definitely got a good feel of the crafts intentions:  Seemingly non¬≠ violent but it had orders and it was doing it‚Äôs job.  The craft seemed to have a mission looking, finding, searching, surveying or just watching and monitoring us in general.",

Now several of them were flying a rectangular pattern in the west horizon, as I was watching with my binoculars I noticed they were flying very fast.  But they would make very abrupt 90 deg turns, way to abrupt for their speed.  Then several were flying east to west and west to east directly over head.  One was flying a  north to south and back in a rectangle pattern.  When he changed his course to the west of the rectangle as it turned there was a distinct triangle pattern to its white lights, with a blinking red light in the middle.  This went on for a half an hour.  It was some really strange maneuvers like I have never seen before. The two jets came out of the south escorting a shinny object that looked like a large satellite moving the same speed of the jets and through the rectangle pattern the one jet had been flying.  They went across the horizon and my view would be about 30 to 40 deg of the horizon.  After the objects went out of view, all the jets split up.  Some them were playing and chasing each other.

I noticed just above the craft, maybe a few thousand feet or so an orange oval object. The object did not change color or shape, and was flying slower than the airliner. I quickly looked around to see if it's a reflection. The sun had already set, and it was still too bright for satellites to be visible. I am an amateur astronomer and astrophotography, I often track satellites. I continued to watch the object till it was too far away to see. The brightness and color remained the same the entire time. The orange color was similar to maybe an afterburner flame from a fighter jet, or from a rocket engine. The size and shape when I first saw it was similar to an oval pill held at arms length. It was moving too slow to be a fireball, and with its consistent speed and shape there is no way it could have been something burning up. My other thought was it being a balloon or a blimp, but again, it was too steady and seemed to be moving faster than I've seen any blimp go. The shape was very smooth, nothing coming off the sides or anything else.",

     "text":"Spotted black hovering UFO of unusual/hard to distinguish shape near parking lot, before flying away at high speed. This sighting was very much a spontaneous encounter on my part, and ended almost as quickly as it began.  I was in my car, parked outside a strip mall next to a park, with a Taekwondo studio and Scuba Diving store in front of me.  I had just dropped off a family member, and was reading a book for college while waiting in the vehicle for my family member to return in about an hour.  A friend called me on my cell phone; I became distracted from reading, and so we talked for about five minutes before the beginning of the UFO encounter.   I was casually looking outside at my surroundings without much attentiveness, when I spotted this apparent craft.  I did not actually think it was an aircraft at all, at first.  I was looking up at the dark/grayish clouds in front of me, and I glanced in the craft‚Äôs direction, thinking I had just seen a small dark break the clouds in my peripheral vision - as if I could see through to a darker cloud layer.  I was not at all alarmed, nor did I suspect it was a flying object.  I continued talking, and when I turned my attention to the area again maybe about 10 seconds later, I looked more closely, and noticed this was not a break in the clouds.  Something was definitely there, well below the cloud layer. I knew very quickly it wasn‚Äôt a bird or plane, because it was hovering completely motionless in the air.  My immediate assumption was that this was a helicopter, which is perfectly reasonable, as I see them fly by from time to time, even at this particular parking lot.   I like to check out aircraft whenever I seen them, so I asked my friend to wait a moment while I sat up closer to my dashboard to focus in on the supposed helicopter.  I saw it was smaller than a helicopter; it had no tail, no propeller blades or moving parts, and made no audible sound.  It was unusually difficult to make out its shape.  This may have been because of its size and the dark backdrop.   But I stared at it for maybe about 20 seconds as it hovered there in the sky, absolutely motionless, expecting it to move.  I was so surprised at how still it was, I even moved my head left to right, just to be sure I wasn‚Äôt somehow staring at a speck of dust on my windshield.  I am pretty sure it had corners; it was not an oval or sphere exactly, but it seemed like it was maybe rounded slightly.   I can‚Äôt say for absolute certain, like I said earlier, the shape was hard to make out - but if I had to guess, it was perhaps a cube or triangle with rounded edges.  Very dark ‚Äì basically black in color, and may have had a small gray or white marking on it, but I cannot say for certain as it could have been a reflection of the sky, if it was metallic.  But from my angle at least, I would describe it as fairly dull; a matte black. In terms of size, I would say it was one to two meters across, and one-half to one meter in height.   I was still on the phone, and began describing the object to my friend, who was listening closely, and became a little concerned for me.  I did not feel threatened by it, but was very curious nonetheless.  I sometimes keep a pair of binoculars in my glove compartment, and so I began quickly rummaging through papers, napkins, and tools I keep in there, while still keeping an eye on the object, only occasionally glancing into the glove compartment fo r a second or two.   I had two plausible explanations in my mind; it was either a big balloon of some kind, or a drone, but I wanted to find out for certain.   At the exact moment I thought that, it started to move slightly to the left, and then a second later bolted off at high speed, traveling backwards, away from me. It did not tilt, turn, or otherwise look like it had control surfaces or a propulsion system.  I became upset it was leaving, and I could not find my binoculars.  Still talking to my friend, I figured I took them out of the compartment a few months ago to bring on a boat trip, and forgot to return them.  The craft left the location pretty fast; in about 15 seconds, it was a tiny little dot, and disappeared somewhere behind buildings or trees.   I found it very unlikely to be a balloon because if it was, it probably would have been smaller and round, likely would have had a string or something attached to it, and would have been ascending at a constant rate, not to mention being bobbed and brushed by the wind - not sitting perfectly still in the air, before suddenly bursting off at a very high speed in basically one direction.   It is hard to guess how high and far it was from my location with only a limited number of items for a point of reference, but I would say no more than a quarter mile from where I was parked.  It was relatively low; my best guess, I would say between 6! 00 and 800 feet above the ground.   When it moved, it began gently, and increased speed very quickly.  I would approximate maybe 250 to 300 mph the last I saw it.  Also note, there was a young man, maybe about 25, sitting in his car parked next to me, but he was facing the opposite direction and was staring at his phone, so I did not bother to ask if he had also seen the craft after it had left.   As far as I could tell, we were the only two people in the parking lot capable of viewing the craft.   Once the surprise and adrenaline rush had worn down, I resumed my conversation with my friend, speculating what it could have been. I regretted not taking a picture with my phone, but on the other hand, it probably would have been too small to turn up as anything more than a few pixels on the image anyway.  I decided to take a picture at least of the sky conditions where the craft was, about five minutes after it left, to give some perspective as to how I saw it. The only plausible and conventional explanation I have was that it was a large, black, very fast moving drone, with long range wireless capabilities.  This is a suburban area, so it was hovering and passing over small buildings, houses, and some forested areas.  I have walked near the place where the craft was in the past, and I know there are some small fields and depressions in the ground, as well as a high school it most definitely would have passed over or near.  I do not know how long it was hovering there prior, but I know it sat still for at least the minute or two that I saw it from when I first glanced it in the sky.  For a craft that size and altitude, it should have had some light beacon to indicate its presence to other aircraft, and I would have expected it to be flatter with four or more distinguishable copter propellers if it was a drone.  This craft did not possess any of those features as far as I could tell, but I would be willing to accept a drone as a conventional answer.  I readily acknowledge that it is just an unidentified flying object.  I am not necessarily trying so suggest this was some event so extraordinary that it exceeds all conventional reasoning, nor that it is of extraterrestrial or otherwise supernatural origin.  It was certainly very odd though, and this is not the first instance in the time I have lived here that I have seen unusual or inexplicable aircraft. There was one other event that occurred on my thirteenth birthday when I was walking home from a store.  I was on the top of a hill nearing my neighborhood next to a forested area with only a couple sleepy houses to my right side, when I spotted a silvery metal craft, oval in shape flying over the forest, completely silent, and traveling at similar heights and speeds to this one. Unlike the case I am presenting here, I do have a picture of the actual craft itself (albeit a poor resolution one) taken from my phone, and posted on Facebook. In the original image, the craft was too small to see without zooming in, but it was nevertheless in the image.  I searched old data folders and even tried to revive the (now dead) phone I took the photo with to see if I could retrieve the original file, but unfortunately could not bring it back. In the Facebook photo of this somewhat similar craft, I enlarged the image of the craft and drew a red line indicating where it was in the image so t! hat people could view it more easily, but other than that, there was no editing or tampering concerning the image of the craft itself. Both that one and this one traveled in about the same direction, heading north-northwest. This was before drones (especially of that size) were commercially available as they are today. I have not made any case files on this previous sighting, and this is the first time I have reported a UFO, because I felt compelled enough to say this really was unusual enough to constitute a true UFO. After showing the first encounter to friends online, they did not believe me, thinking I had pocket lint on my camera, even though I assured them something was in the air. I dropped the topic, and rarely spoke of it again, but with this new sighting, it has made me think back on that experience. I am not suggesting there is any direct connection or correlation, but these events are similar in some ways, and this new encounter marks the second time I have seen! an unusual or unconventional aircraft in this area, seven yea! rs apart , in the same stretch of about 5 miles.

Tonight, around 8:30pm, I had this urge to look out our back sliding glass door, and to my surprise, I saw the full moon and it seemed bigger/closer than usual and extremely bright!  So bright that it not only gave more light into the sky, but it also produced a ring shape light onto the ground and the middle was shadowed.  I told my mom & step dad then returned to the door to admire the strangeness to it.  I glanced up to the right of the moon and that‚Äôs when I saw the first craft.  It was very close at first, there was no sound from it, I could see 3 different color lights that appeared to be spinning in a circle, most were white but there was at least 1 blue and 1 red light,  I yelled for my step dad to come see it because it was just hovering in the air.  It didn‚Äôt appear to be moving at first and a few minutes later you could see it gradually moving farther away and upward into the sky.  It would also move slightly right or left.  It wasn‚Äôt going fast like it had a des! tination to get to but seemed to be scanning the area.  Once it was too far to see all three lights as well as when it was close another aircraft showed up from the right.  This one did have a faint sound and was going quite fast.  It only had a white light, the light would flash once disappear and then flash again when it got some distance away.  It went right in front of the first craft slightly turned flying left under the moon & right above the tree line.  It then stayed in one area but going upwards and downwards until it just disappeared.  A few minutes later i saw the same flashing light craft much farther left, it was going slow at first, but sped up to disappear around the side of the house.  During all of this the other one was still just hovering in the same spot, it would get a little closer and then go back farther/higher again.  It continued to do this, around 10 I had to stop looking to put my son to bed.  I kept checking until 10:30pm or 11 and that‚Äôs when it was fin! ally out of sight.  This sighting was the most amazing for me because t his craft didn‚Äôt seem to mind that it was seen and it stayed hovering around the same area the longest amount of time I‚Äôve ever seen any kind of craft do..  while the others seemed to make sure it was not in any danger.  Myself, my mom, step dad and 3 year old all got a great look at this amazing sighting & were all amazed by it.  My puppy also broke off his chain around the time this first occurred, we usually hear him barking or running around the house when this happens but he was extremely calm and was drawn to the ring light & would look toward the craft.",

But we think it was firecrackers‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ So two anomalous things last night.  Glad we found all your reports; made us feel we were not imagining what we all saw.  It was pretty memorable.   Also a regular airplane with regular white strobe, red and green light seemed to chase the last orb.  We also filed this report because of the number of similar recent reports once we checked.",

On October 3, 2019,  between 6:55 p.m. and 7:20 p.m., myself and at least 4 other people observed 4 oblong or pod shape or pill shape or cigar shape flying objects.  The objects  changed from bright red to silver-like color in the clear, almost cloudless sky above the Fulton YWCA soccer field in Winston-Salem, NC, where children were practicing soccer. The objects were definitely not airplanes as they were very close and moving too slow and would have fallen from the sky. There were no wings or smoke trails.  They were not drones because the objects would get larger and then small again.  The objects seemed to appear out of nowhere.  They would randomly disappear in plain sight and reappear from nowhere.  One of the objects did take off across the same area of the sky very fast and then slow down again. The objects all moved horizontally and not vertically, not  upward nor downward.  Two of the objects seemed to fly within the particular area of the sky and stop (or disappear and then reappear) and then fly back facing the other objects in close proximity of each other.  I watched three disappear in the sky and not return to view.  The fourth one finally moved beyond the tall tree tops where I could no longer observe it. During the approximate 25 minutes, myself and another observer tried to take pictures or videos of the objects with our cell phones to no avail.  People other than the 4 of us who observed the flying objects seemed oblivious to the objects being there, as if it was commonplace to see such objects.  No one else seemed to care.  I showed the 4 objects to my granddaughter, but she was more interested in a grasshopper she had spotted in the grass.",

On Sunday September 13, 2009, at approximately 9:00 PM, I and a few friends witnessed a hovering object high up in the night sky within the Chicago city limits, on the north side, Lincoln Park area. One hour after first spotting this object, I managed to take a picture using my 5MP camera phone with auto flash.  We watched this stationary object just sit idle in free air. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to take the picture because I didn't believe my friends who were outside watching it for an hour.  I stayed inside the house. Object's Position They said that it was a lot closer to the earth before I decided to go outside and view.  So the image I took was basically its very, very slow ascent back up into the stars.  Even though we were in downtown Chicago, it was a pretty starry night with some stratus clouds high up, but the only thing you can see in this picture is the brilliant amber-red spherical object. You don't see the stars in the picture, just the red object.  I tried magnifying the view of the object, but of course it's blurry.  I really need to share this story with someone credible if this helps us understand the big picture of things. Objects Ruled Out I'm not saying that what I saw was a UFO, but I can say that I have never seen any type of flying or floating vehicle, or weather condition, planet, satellite or lightning like the thing I saw that night. I'm so glad I was able to capture it when I did, because I was shaking and tried to grasp some kind of reasonable explanation for what I saw, but nothing came to mind.  I want to share with you my experience and photo if you are interested. This is a real image. You have to zoom to the red speck at the center.  This was taken at my friends place in the Lincoln Park subdivision of Chicago, the night of Sept. 13, 2009 during the Bears/Green Bay week 1 game at 9:00pm CST. This object appeared right around halftime facing the northwest horizon and much lower in elevation.  It stayed stationary, never changing direction.  I finally took this picture at approximately 10:00 PM. Object Hovers  What you see is something I and a few friends can't explain.  Outside the house my buddies were first to notice this thing around 9:00 PM.  They kept telling us to come out and watch this thing floating in the air and not moving.  We didn't believe him so we just kept watching the game inside. I finally gave in and went out to their backyard and witnessed what they were watching.  I could not offer any explanation to what I saw.  The following are things I have ruled out that this wasn't: -No aircraft (blimp, balloon, helicopter, airplane) -No comet, star or planet. -No low earth orbiting satellite Spherical in Appearance I could not decipher any shape of the object.  It looked spherical, and I couldn't tell if there were more than one.  It was definitely higher in elevation than the Sears Tower.  I'd say approximately more than 5,000 to 10,000 feet. My first reaction was to call someone miles away from our location just to verify the same unexplainable thing in the night sky.  Of course, nobody would answer their phone because they were probably watching the game.  I really wish I took video but I was actually shaking, because I was kind of excited to see this thing. It was amazing and frightened to watch.  I still want to believe that it was man-made, but my gut tells me that it's not, nor a natural phenomena",

     "text":"Green laser ball spontaneously appears at elevation of low-flying airplane, then almost zips away into black sky I was leaving my cousin's house and having a few last minutes in conversation with her on the porch.  I was looking at her face as we talked, and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something that captured my attention.  I reflexively and immediately shifted my gaze towards it, and I saw a bluish-green sphere of intense laser-like light, which must have appeared out of nowhere (because it was so bright that, had it been there before, I definitely would have noticed).  It was at an elevation of a low-flying helicopter, or an airplane that hasn't completed even the initial leg of its post-takeoff ascent.  Its bluish-green was similar in color neither to that of any falling star nor that of any comet I've ever seen. My knee-jerk reaction was to blurt out \"Whoa!\", but it had disappeared even before I had finished the exclamation.  By \"it had disappeared,\" I mean I saw it zip away in a short streak of its intense bluish-green light, at a speed exponentially faster than any aircraft (commercial, recreational, military, or otherwise) I've ever seen.  The laser light ball jetted from its stationary position like a Star Wars spaceship \"jumping to light speed\" or \"entering hyperspace;\" after an unbelievably quick (in time) and short (in distance) dart, it literally looked like it \"teleported\" into the blackness of the sky, but on a very straight trajectory. Unfortunately, only I saw this and not my cousin, who was with me but facing the wrong way.  The next day at work, the industrial photocopy machine I have used daily for the past three years inexplicably shut itself off twice when I touched it, which I cannot recall it otherwise ever doing in the past three years I've worked with it.  (The office tech guys denied remotely rebooting it, and I have no reason to disbelieve them, especially since they were unaware of my sighting the previous night, the knowledge of which may have made them prone to playing such a prank on me.)",

Others were observed flying independently North and South of 1-10 mainly between Fry Rd and Mason road. One craft flew directly over my wife's vehicle and she put her head out the window and heard a tiny swoosh sound. We then came home and watched the crafts appear spontaneously in the sky over our backyard at a rate of 1-2 craft every five minutes. The craft actually looked like fighter jets from the 50's and 60's but seemed to have a circular formation around them and pulsing red and green lights and a yellowish orange light that remained constant. The body of the craft also seemed to concave upwardly and outwardly like an upside down pyramid but much more subtle.  The white/off white jet fighter part of the craft(s) looked to have a very fat fuselage and had a very distinctive cross shape.  It was hard to see the circular part of the craft but you could see that it extended out from the main body and was much darker in color.  One would think it was a normal aircraft other than the fact that some of them seemed to sit still and no more than the minor swoosh sound could be heard. One thing that really stuck out is that they just kept coming from the west almost like bombers on a test run, many of them continued into Houston and some seemed to disappear. My first thought was that this could be some type of Harrier craft of even a type of silent helicopter but nothing really added up. I have never seen anything like it. We (my family) watched them for about an hour, checked the news reports, made a few calls and really found no explanation.",

     "text":"Ultra-fast fly-by of 2 ufo's with associated light, noise, energy, electrical interference, UV radiation I swear this account is entirely accurate and 100% honest based on my unforgettable recollection and account made immediately after the event. I would testify to this in a court of law before God. Myself, Philip Burke, and Wesley Jinks, all eagle scouts and college students, witnessed strikingly similar events. I won the poker game and we stepped outside so Phil could smoke a cigarette. Phil was smoking under the porch by the basement sliding door. Wesley was walking back from his car after getting his wallet so he could pay up for his poker loss and was turning the southeast corner of the house when this incident began. I was completely sober because the antibiotics I‚Äôm taking react violently with alcohol. It was between 2:55 and 3:00 AM, December 24th, 2006. I was centered on the east edge of my back patio off the basement. I was looking almost directly up at the northeast sky at maybe a 75 degree angle, attempting to look for the stars. It was evenly overcast that night with no rain and very little wind, about 40 degrees F and relatively calm outside. Very low level clouds in even formation meant that no stars could be seen. All three of us encountered two distinct identical waves of energy that streaked the sky with associated noise, light, and perceptible electric and magnetic energy unlike anything we had ever seen, heard or felt in our experience. I consider myself to have a sharp perceptional awareness and to be in touch with my senses. I was once missed by a lightning strike by 10 feet in a rainstorm and felt incredibly jolted, but this experience shocked or jolted me electrically ten times more than this previous lightning incident. I could tell the pulse was also very magnetic in nature, having had an MRI less than two months ago, and several in the past two years. I was mid sentence and went instantly silent when I was frozen by a sudden blast of energy coming from the sky. The blast originated in the west-northwest sky and moved east-southeast, crossing the entire sky from horizon to horizon in maybe two seconds, no idea as to altitude. There was initially no light associated with this blast, only pure energy. I could feel this energy. It coursed through my body. It felt like a concentrated pulse of electric and magnetic energy. This wave of energy that hit my body felt like the rush from jets doing a low altitude fly-by at an air show, only instead of wind, it was a burst of electric and magnetic energy that grew gradually, drastically spiked, then trailed off. As this pulse moved directly over my head it seemed to convey my entire body with it in the direction of its path. It was strongest at this point. I was frozen still in fear and my upper body wavered east-southeast as if I were getting pushed and pulled at the same time, only nothing physically touched me except energy. I moved my foot to keep myself from being pushed over, otherwise I feel as if I would have been knocked down. As this pulse approached, the associated noise quickly turned from a low drone or buzz to a tinny screech that was deafeningly loud for a fraction of a second then returned to a low drone. It was louder than anything I‚Äôve ever heard for that brief fraction of a second when it seemed to pass overhead. I covered my ears but kept my eyes wide open. As this pulse approached and the drone got louder, the sky filled with an ambiance of alternating green and blue waves that seemed to radiate linearly and at short regular intervals out from the path of travel of this pulse. The waves lit the overcast sky more and more brightly during the pulse‚Äôs rapid approach, like they were being projected on the clouds from above the cloud ceiling. The brightness approached the brightness of day but everything around me had an eerie blue-green cast. An instant after the noise got unbearable, immediately as it began to subside, the entire sky filled with an array of every color in the visible spectrum for a brief instant, brighter than anything I have ever seen in the atmosphere, including the light of day at high noon. At this point I was facing east, looking up at a 45 degree angle. It seemed as if the pulse just passed. The sky was splotched with every color in the spectrum shining on the clouds in an instant dazzling array, predominately oranges and reds. It seemed as if a 3D electric matrix of visible fine lightning-like electricity filled the sky and approached from the east, went over my head. This matrix of many hundreds of tiny electric bolts, blue green in color, may have entered the lightning rods of my house. This is unclear because my eyes were still recovering from the brightness of the flash. The previous blue green waves mentioned may have lasted two seconds and grown in intensity, but this rainbow colored flash with the electrical matrix lasted maybe a quarter of a second. The power in the house then went off completely with no associated surge or fade. It just cut out then came back on about a second later. ! The neig hbor‚Äôs floodlight remained on. All was calm and quiet for a second or two and my fear caused me to begin to turn towards the house to seek cover as I still looked at the sky. I then remembered Wesley was out front and I stayed outside to see if he saw anything. As he was approaching from the southeast corner of the house, maybe 75 feet away, ALL OF WHAT I HAVE RECOLLECTED THUS FAR WAS REPEATED IDENTICALLY, only we were paying closer attention to the sky now, so it seemed more extreme. I‚Äôm uncertain whether it was or not. Both sets of pulses, flashes, buzzes, and power outages occurred in maybe ten or twelve seconds total. During the hour following this incident my ears hurt as if I had been at a rock concert that lasted for a week. My eyes hurt like I just walked out of a pitch black cave and stared at the sun. The cable TV and internet did not work until the next day. Once I regained my footing after the first blast, I felt like I was in instant shock, not from disbelief but from the actual energy inside me. I felt like I was filled to the brim with free electrons. My heart rate instantaneously spiked to its maximum and stayed there for quite some time. My body did sort of a hormonal dump, not quite like going into shock, but similar. It felt wonderful and terrible, as I imagine trying crack cocaine for the first time would be. These feelings gradually normalized over the course of two hours. Immediately after we came inside following the second pulse, we all confirmed something very, very weird just happened. I insisted no one speak of it and we all write separate personal accounts. Before we started writing, I ventured back outside and gazed at the sky for a couple minutes to find out if I could see anything else. The once thick cloud cover had opened to a strip of clear sky. This strip of clear sky was bordered by parallel lines of cloud cover on each side. The strip of clear sky appeared exactly where I sensed the two blasts had traveled horizontally through the sky from west northwest to east southeast. It looked as if the strip was opened by parting winds in opposite directions in the atmosphere. It stretched from horizon to horizon. I noticed Phil had dropped a lit cigarette on the ground. As I gathered paper I felt like I was on a mild dose of ten different drugs at once and my heart rate would not move from its peak. Wesley agreed to write an account, but Phil was ghost white and looked like he was about to have a heart attack. He noticed the cable TV signal had been lost (it worked fine before this incident) and opted for bed instead. Wesley and I did not speak to each other at all as we wrote, and only when we both finished did the results appear incredibly similar in every detail. While writing, I tried to relax and slow my racing pulse. As I did this, I experienced a euphoric pain free sensation originating in my spine and neck. I felt like I was five years old physically, except my heart ached like I was 80. As I wrote from maybe 3:10 AM to 4:30 AM this euphoric feeling gradually shifted from my spine to my muscles where I experienced major muscle relaxation. It seemed as if the electricity left me in waves starting at my core that rapidly moved to the surface. Each wave lasted about four seconds, and there must have been hundreds of them. As these hundreds of individual waves of electricity made it to the skin, I would get the strongest goosebumps I‚Äôve ever had and my hair would stand on end, noticeably on my arms. The feeling of muscle relaxation progressed to the point where I collapsed with my arms and chest on the table for about ten minutes where I could not write. I was motionless, simply enjoying the feeling when I was suddenly overcome by a strange migraine centered immediately behind my right ear near the surface of the skin. It was intense and piercing, and caused me to pick myself up, no longer experiencing any positive feeling symptoms. This migraine was very short lived and disappeared completely after only a couple of minutes. I have no history of headaches and have been routinely staying awake until 2-4 AM for about a month straight, so I felt no undue fatigue during any of this whole experience. The headache was enough to convince me I should go to bed. I tried to think about other things and eventually fell asleep. I slept through the night and woke up the next day with a sunburn on my face and hands, with redness and mild pain. My medication makes me very sensitive to UV radiation and I have been avoiding the sun completely. I ate breakfast, but could not keep it down. The cable TV came back on suddenly at about noon. Let me know what you think. THIS WAS THE WEIRDEST OF THE WEIRD.",

     "text":"Cylinder or Cigar Shaped Object (Vertical) with 3 Orange Lights I am reporting this sighting for my girlfriend, my teenage son and his teenage girlfriend.  Unfortunately I was out of town on business at the time. As my 16 year old son left to drive his girlfriend home, he noticed strange lights in one of our fields/pastures on our property.  He thought at first that some lights may have been left on down near the hunting lodge about 200 yards from the main house.  Upon returning, he summoned my girlfriend to walk outside and look.  They determined it was in the field and nowhere near the lodge and in fact all power to the lodge was off.  They both described it as capsule shaped but vertical not horizontal.  It was three separate orange lights stacked on top of each other forming the capsule/cylinder. What is important to note here is this:  There is no access to that field other than our driveway/road which is 3/4 of mile long and blocked with a security gate.  The field is surrounded by thick (really thick woods) and a large creek surrounds the field in a horseshoe fashion.  Again... the only way in and out is to drive directly by our home. They watched it for 5 minutes and called me.  I tried to convince them to take a shotgun and drive out in my 4x4.  They refused.  This actually angered me because I was thinking there may be trespassers on the property but they said they could hear nothing and there was no movement.  They literally locked themselves in the house for the night and had trouble sleeping.  Upon returning home, I asked them separately to draw the object.  They did, and they both had the same exact description.  My son's girlfriend described the same thing, as she saw it 20 minutes prior.  They never stayed outside to watch it until it did whatever it did to go out or \"leave\".  This is due to the fact that in order to see it, they had to walk about 50 yards from the house in the dark in order to see it. Personally I'm upset that they did check it out.  I may sound like a bad dad, but I'm a firm believer in protecting my property.",

One would move towards another and stop. it seemed like they  touched,then 30 or so seconds it went back to its ariginal position.

The objects did not resemble any aircraft that I was aware of. I just turned 10 years of age and I was raised during the vietnam war,and saw many aircraft fly by our house. I had seen many hot air baloons,etc. but nothing like this. WITNESSES, me,6 brothers and sisters, 2 friends of the family,drivers by that stopped at the road side, and finally two lake county sheriff deputies . what  confused us was that the deputies were called  to leave the premises shortly after they arrived. why didnt they stay with us! we had observed them for about 1.5 hours. one of the friends of the family was so scared that he had his shotgun loaded in our house when he called the sheriffs dept. my father always raised us to never have a loaded gun in the house. Our family were raised as hunters so saftey was taught as no loaded guns in the house. I think  that was justified that time. when the objects flew off they left a very short streak of light and instantly disappeared. Later that night I could not sleep. I kept looking outside the window and saw somthing in the big tree on our property. like I was being watched. My life has never been the same. Their has been other incounters since that I could not explain. Flashes of light by the top corner of my window where I use to live,when I was 30 -35 years of age. I visited a catholic priest.went in the church to tell him what was troubling me and at that moment when I said that I and now my ex girlfriend had been seeing flashes of light, in! stantly a huge flash of light went off in an ajoining room in the church. The father said I saw that one.we were the only two in the church at that time. my partner and I do concrete construction and 5 or so years ago saw a very shiny spherical object in the daylight sky at about noon or so.not a cloud in the sky that day.stayed motionless for 1 hour.the object stay in the same position but got smaller and smaller till we lost reference where it was. All of the witnesses that have seen these things that I have seen live normal lives just like I . I dont know? Is it normal to see these things. I wish that I never would of seen what I did so I can sleep better at night! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

     "text":"Bright stationary circular object in high atmosphere in broad daylight gives way to five smaller moving crescents June 8, 2008. Approximately 7:30 PM -- While playing in the backyard with my children, my daughter called my attention to what she called the first star tonight -- she was excited because at this time of year it is still very light, with the sun well above the horizon -- essentially still daytime. I initially took it to be a star, located about 2 degrees NE of a crescent-shaped moon. The size seemed about right for a star, but I quickly realized that it was WAY too bright to be a star, as it was still daylight and no other stars were even faintly visible. I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look. It appeared to be a circular object in the high atmosphere, with a dark spot in the center -- exactly what one might expect from a weather balloon with something suspended below it, such as a basket with equipment. And the brightness of the object seemed consistent with a balloon reflecting the sun. What was strange was that the object maintained it's position relative to the moon for about five minutes, which is not the behavior one would expect of a high-altitude weather balloon that is subject to strong air currents. After a few minutes of observation, the object simply disappeared in a blink. For a good minute I thought it was gone, but with more scoping with binoculars I saw five smaller points of light in the same vicinity. These were too small to be seen with the naked eye, and they were barely visible with binoculars. The mind tries to make sense of things. I speculated that a weather balloon could have exploded into smaller pieces. This time, unlike the initial round \"star\" object, these smaller points were crescent-shaped, and they drifted SW until they moved past the moon, growing more faint as they traveled. It occurred to me that a spherical object in the sky would reflect sunlight in the same way the moon did and assume a crescent shape. This suggests the smaller objects were spherical. This does not explain, however, why the initial \"star\" appeared perfectly round. Forgive me for a flight of fancy, but a flat, round shaped object -- such as a pie tin -- situated at just the right angle would reflect light across it's entire surface and appear round to an observer. I can't come up with an obvious explanation for what I observed. What I saw was certainly not an airplane. Very unlikely it was an exploding weather balloon (how could the intact balloon remain stationary while it's exploded parts drifted in the wind?). Puzzling indeed. One final observation. Seems like an odd coincidence. While observing the crescents in binoculars, a Southwest airline flying at what appeared to be a MUCH lower altitude passed right in between two of the crescent shapes. What are the odds that a commercial airline passes through the tiny window of observation -- relative to the rest of the sky -- visible through one's binoculars at just the right moment under any circumstances? Quite a coincidence. The entire sequence took roughly 10 minutes. Crescents faded from view within 10 seconds of the airline passing through my field of vision. Again, Helluva coincidence. Nevertheless, I really don't think the airline was related to the objects. Airline was low altitude (either landing or taking off from local airport), and the objects were really high.

While flying quad-copters for the day at a school on Saturday afternoon, I turned to the north and noticed 2 lights in the sky that were distinct from the high clouds.  At first, I believed these to parachutes or para-motor type craft, but was confused, given the fact that the winds were beginning to make our flights difficult on the ground, and when I called attention to it to my friend who was flying quads with me, she too saw the same two craft and we immediately began to try to match it to known aircraft or explanations. The two craft were seen at an elevation of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon and were due north of my position.  The craft were moving in relation to one another with the top left craft from my position being brighter while the second similarly shaped craft was less distinct and even somewhat translucent.  After a time the second craft was no longer seen and the brighter and larger craft stayed in view for many minutes.  I attempted to film the craft with my on-board quad-copter camera but the lens for both this and my camcorder I had were not at all appropriate to this kind of a sighting and thus nothing was captured.  In fact, the quad-copter camera mysteriously did not even have a record of the flight even though I had made certain to activate the camera and there was plenty of space left on the SD card!  Early on in the sighting, the two craft were moving quite erratically and in revolutions clockwise around the other as if they were orbiting one another.  My first thought was of a parachutist or para-motor craft in trouble with a bad chute then I realized how high these objects were and that it couldn't possibly be one or more chutes.  We couldn't identify any noise coming from these craft.  The lights were constant in brightness at first and there was no variation until the smaller craft began to fade from view. As we watched, the motion of the bright light transitioned to a smooth rotating motion clockwise and slightly descending to the lower right towards the other object which seemed to rotate with it.  The other object maintained it's distance from the larger during this change of altitude.  When the brighter object suddenly stopped its rotation, the shape for both was seen as a diamond shape for both craft by both of us.  The distinct edges and structure were then apparent and it was obviously a pair of physical objects. The objects were behind the high thin clouds at times (still easily seen through the clouds) and my estimation of their height would be in the thousands of feet in the air. Other conventional aircraft in the air before, during and after the sighting were seen and this was definitely lower than commercial jet traffic but higher than the thin clouds. Given the distance and elevation, these had to be of considerable size. A commercial jet I saw during the sighting at 30,000 feet or so to the west had about the same apparent diameter as the larger bright diamond shape, so the object we were watching would be estimated to have a size approaching 50 to 100 feet as a very unscientific guess. The other object which \"dissolved\" from view was of a smaller size and perhaps was 75% of the size of the larger brighter diamond shape.  I also considered that the sighting might be a jet coming towards me with navigation lights on, but this was ruled out when the slow orbiting motion was observed. No jet or prop aircraft would do this since this would mean a aileron roll to the pilot's left or 45 to 60 degrees (to match what I was seeing) which would then have produced strong movement to the right from my point of view (unless the pilot was doing aerobatics which definitely was not the case here). Additionally, both objects had a long period of hovering in one position coupled with a slow movement to the east by 10 or so degrees over a period of minutes mystified me and made me rule out normal aircraft. I also considered if this was a balloon, blimp, glider or a helicopter. The observation of the two objects satisfied none of these explanations as we both attempted to ascertain what we were seeing.  I also considered astronomical causes. No meteor trail was noted. It was not a planet, since the ecliptic was to my back since I was facing due north during daylight hours. It was not a supernova, comet or any other natural sky-borne phenomena that I have ever encountered. Around 14:05 hours Pacific, I pointed a camcorder towards the object and was marking my position in relation to it.  The sole remaining diamond shape object was clearly visible with only a few whispy clouds near it and I turned the camera away and then back to the position of the object only to find is was nowhere to be seen.  In a matter of seconds, it had vanished. One notable event occurred some minutes afterwards.  A lower altitude Cessna or similar style aircraft that appeared to be completely painted black appeared from the north and at a much lower altitude.  If overflew us directly at an altitude of around 1500 feet and was flying extremely slowly.  I cannot say if this was related, but it certainly caught my interest given the direction of travel and behavior. I have spent a lifetime in around rocket and aircraft systems and have spent 30+ years in amateur astronomy.  I have flown in fighter aircraft as a civilian and know the full range of U.S. and foreign civilian and military aircraft from past and current fleets.  This matched none of the craft or natural astronomical phenomena I have ever seen or have knowledge of.  I cannot say what we saw, but it was certainly an unknown and my hope is that someone else in the area saw it and can add their testimony to the sighting and perhaps identify what it was.",

Upon entrance of the back porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a tubular shaped flying vehicle beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1000 yards away from shore!I turned to Mom and We both began to more or less \"freak-out\" about what We were seeing! I then instructed her to examine every detail about this \"thing\" so that We could better remember it's design. Imagine,if you will,say a 747 jet without any wings or tail,only gigantical and unpainted,the bare metal design showing no rivets whatsoever.Windows adorned the side from front to back and forms of occupants were hazily seen behind some in the mid-section.It made no noise! I! t hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf[speculation].I then left Mom and ran to the car and sped away at at least 80m.p.h. in a 20m.p.h. zone to the Phelps' pier at the end of Carolina Ave. North and slung the car around to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship. This angered local residents who came to confront my recklessness , but once I pointed to that \"thing\" all was astonished at \"it\".As it neared I clicked my bright headlights on it. It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like a circle and had it's light off. It began to hover over me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently PRAY!! When I looked back up ,it slowly moved back to surf just beyond the pier and \"blasted\" is too slow the term for it's departure! Instantly in the distance Wrightsville Beach N.C. lit up from the u.f.o.'s lightbeam. After a few min. the same thing began at Topsail Beach'N.C. . This happened up the North Carol! ina eastern coastline untill it faded from my sight. When I ! ! returned home my mom said local news would carry the story at 11:00 which was just coming up. In a brief report , they mentioned that the u.f.o. sightings being called in was nothing more than a \"Coast Guard Drug Survailence Vehicle\"! O.K. Carolina Beach 'You remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!  UPDATE AND CORRECTIONS TO ORIGINAL POST ABOVE  I wanted to be more precise on this as it was something that was vague in it's post back then. I just wanted to clarify it.It bothers me that so far only the first witness(my mom)has responded and posted about this event. As best as I can recollect,(as the exact time frame escapes me),it was in the summer start in 1987 of mid April. I was a local resident of Carolina Beach, NC. Lying on my back in bed, playing an electric guitar unplugged, I began to hear my mother yelling from our back porch that she was seeing a UFO. After ignoring her three times,I was finally compelled to rise up and go check the situation out because she had just frantically ran up to my locked door and screamed out... \"It's a close encounter of the 3rd kind!\" So with that statement it really got my attention and upon my entrance out the back door onto the porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a very large and long tubular shaped flying vehicle that was beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1,000 yards away from shore! I turned to Mom and we both began to more or less \"freak-out\" about what we were seeing! I was astonished at it's huge dimensions and how far it spanned down the! coastline to it's right from it's front front. It had large rectangular windows that started from behind the nose section all the way to the rear. I was stunned at the close up encounter of this ship because of it's magnitude and awe commanding presence. I turned and looked at my mom and saw an expression I had never seen on her face and told her ...\"You should see the look on your face\" and she replied the same thing back to me! I then instructed her to please examine and to pay close attention to every detail about this \"thing\" so that we could better remember it's design having no camera to capture the image. I told her to remember the details and we were to write them down on paper later that night while all was fresh on our minds. We then began pointing out to each other how this airship has no signs of being assembled and riveted. It was so flawless. No signs on it at all of any wear or rust or scratches etc. We were close enough looking right from the back porch tha! t if I had a rock I could have struck it with ease as there wa! s no way I could have missed the monster sized UFO. Imagine a 747 jet shape without any wings or tail or front windows but only gigantic and unpainted. It rose very high and was very round and blimpish. Bare metal in design and showing no rivets whatsoever. Gigantic rectangular windows adorning the side from front to back (which by the way was easily several football fields long or yet longer in length) and there was this greenish/yellowish blurry light in the center section with forms of occupants that were hazily seen because it seemed to make you unable to focus upon them. It made no noise! It hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf with a blinding beam of light that shot out from it's bottom side. This wide and bright light did not shine outwards but stayed in a curtain like drop from the bottom that lit up the ocean water like the color of a swimming pool looks in lights at night while all surroundings were dark grayish night. It was slowly passin! g by but still right in front of us when I decided to get the car and go down the road towards the end of the island to see it approaching from that view. I left mom by herself on the back porch and grabbed her car keys off a hook on the wall by the front doorway and took her Plymouth Volare without her permission (my car had a weak battery before this)and sped away at at least 80 MPH in the 20 MPH zone to get to the Phelps' pier at the end of Carolina Avenue North. When I got there I slung the  steering wheel a hard right and spun the car around in order to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship that soon would hopefully arrive. This angered some local residents but especially disturbed some tourists who confronted my recklessness from the balconies of some adjacent condos. They began \"telling me off\" and how they had indeed called the police. The police department was less than a mile away and it would just take minutes to get there. I told them...\"Good... we're gon! na need them!\" That comment seemed to scare them as if I had j! ust thre atened them. I recall they had a Queens New York styled or New Jersey type accent/dialect. One particular man in that group asked me why was I acting so strange and what was I trying to accomplish by my odd reckless behavior. I had gotten the car stuck in the sand and had it in a weird position and I now was just standing outside the driver's side door with my leg inside ready to click the high beams on. I replied...\"You'll see\"! He thought I was crazy and my answers were a threat. But I was so focused on trying to locate that UFO thing that nothing bothered me. It was a grayish dark night. The UFO had turned off it's lights and I could not see it. I walked out to the surf and looked right down the shoreline and it was nowhere to be seen. I was standing there thinking I was about to be arrested or took away to be evaluated when it dawned on me I was looking right at it! From the direct front it was a large circle! It blended in with the sky but was coming onward straight ahe! ad like I hoped it was. I ran to the car and positioned my foot above the high beam switch on the floorboard. That man continued asking me why I doing the things I was and that cops would be here any minute and I knew if I said anything about a UFO that it would only go from bad to worse so I just pointed at the area where it soon would appear and said ...\"Just keep lookin' right there fellow!\" As it neared I clicked the bright headlights on it. Two small headlight dots appeared upon the giant blimp like structure. They all saw it and began to go insanely frightened and saying all kinds of stuff and it caused me to smirk when they began asking me what it was etc.(As if I knew!)It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like that circle. It began to hover right over me.I knew I had made this event happen by not minding my own business and it was now hovering at me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently pray!I was so scared that I sm! ashed my face into the sand and was screaming out to God to sa! ve me. I think I repented for things I never did but feared I was perhaps about to die by maybe that light that can come from it's underside. That man that talked to/at me earlier was saying...\"You can come up from there...it's leaving! It's backing up man!\" But I was too frightened to believe him but he kept insisting it was cool to look up. So when I looked up it was slowly moving backwards just beyond the pier and then it turned so precise and they all saw its huge cigar shape just long enough to get a good mental picture and in just a split second it \"blasted\" (too slow of a term)away! More screams and explicatives came from the condo balconies and I pointed to the horizon to the left where the night lights of Wrightsville Beach NC were twinkling from and then instantly there in the distance, Wrightsville Beach NC lit up from that UFO's light beam. After a few minutes the same thing began to repeat itself at Topsail Beach etc. This happened up the North Carolina eastern coastlin! e until it faded like \"heat lightning\" from our sight. Those people who were angered at me...well they helped me get out of the sand and I went back home never once encountering an officer of the law kind! When I returned home my mom gave me an earful for leaving her alone and taking her car but then said that the local news was going to carry the story at 11:00 PM which was just coming up. In a brief report by a girl who's first name was Michelle, they mentioned that the UFO sightings being called in was nothing more than a \"Coast Guard Drug Surveillance Vehicle\" ! (I later asked the local news station for a copy of that broadcast and they told me that they don't archive news broadcasts). My mom and I both that very night had drawn our pictures of the craft and wrote out our affidavits about our encounter and put them in a separate file among the important paperworks stored in a special closet. Later that year we had to move and that particular paperwork was all we found missing! Many years went by and I've told this event to hundreds of listeners. I once told a retired Air Force officer and he cussed me out and told me that I had better keep my @#$%% mouth shut if I knew what was good for me. He continued cussing me out until I was red faced and hot under the collar and he drove off down the wrong side of the highway pulled over at a nearby phone booth and made a phone call. My wife was disturbed and asked me to quit telling others. Later that night when we got home, we found someone had entered our home with no sign of breaking in. We never found anything out of place except that someone had entered the house and installed a new cartridge of ink in our printer and used over half of it. It's like they wanted us to know it. The strangest part of my encounter is that it was not late and had not been dark very long when I laid back to play my guitar. But when I returned home it was almost eleven o' clock. I was not abducted. I did not recall anything longer than perhaps thirty minutes time taking place. That missing time thing has bothered me. And those people on the balconies may have took photos. They had a lot of time to do that. And the police never showed up. And the TV station constantly shows archived footages of old news. If I'm sounding somewhat paranoid then it's only because I have what I consider to be good valid reasons. And to make it even weirder is that in the very same location where the UFO was first encountered, me and my brother-in-law both watched the figure of a person come out of the surf there one night in what seemed like gray flannel attire compete with a hood that covered the head and although it should have been dripping wet it's attire was completely dry and flapping in the wind and then it just vaporized in front of us! For readers this is the 800 block of Carolina Avenue North. OK Carolina Beach people in April of '87... you remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!

     "text":"Orange, spherical light moving erratically. I live in a rural area.  Frequently I go for long walks at night.  Tonight I was almost back to my driveway when I noticed 2 lights in the Southwestern sky underneath about 80% cloud cover.  The one to the left was a blinking navigation light traveling in a linear fashion - obviously a plane.  The one to the right was larger, spherical, and glowing orange.  It was slightly larger than a plane's navigation light would appear. I watched the light and noticed it moving quickly and erratically, like an insect around a lamp.  The light continued this kind of frenetic motion predominately upwards before disappearing into the clouds. About a month prior I had a similar, initial sighting.  That time it was much higher up and directly overhead.  I could pick out jets and stars as a reference, but this orange light moved erratically in a way that I had never seen before.  I watched it for what felt like a solid 10 minutes - just buzzing around up there nonsensically.  I realized just how high up it was when the light traveled behind a whispy cloud (one of those upper level cirrus clouds).  At that point I went back to the house. A friend of mine observed something similar in late July, but I can't speak for him.",

     "text":"Spherical metallic object seen in broad daylight above University Hospital. 16:00 ‚Äì I‚Äôm a cancer researcher at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Aurora, Colorado.   I left the research complex a bit early today and began walking to my car.  When I reached my car, I opened the door to get in, and I momentarily turned back toward the research buildings.  I saw a large object in the sky, and a quick comparison allowed me to estimate its altitude to be three times as high as the research building.  This was, of course, without knowing the ultimate size of the object, or the distance at which it appeared, so altitude was merely estimated.  My first thought was a helicopter, being on the campus of a university hospital, but there was no sound - absolutely no sound.  This caused me to look closer.  The object appeared to be quite large, larger than a helicopter, and spherical in shape.  Metallic silver best describes the color, with flashes of reddish-silver as the object caught the bright sunlight.  The object appeared to be hovering, slightly bobbing back, forth, up and down, as if it was a gigantic weightless balloon, tethered to the ground, accosted by the wind.  But the movements seemed different ‚Äì as if they were defying gravity.  Up, then sideways, then quickly backward.  I‚Äôve never seen any aircraft move that way.  Then, suddenly, the object shot upward and was nearly out of view within a few seconds.  I could still see the shining sunlight reflecting off of the object at its new altitude.  Suddenly, I was able to see a smaller, white object orbiting the object, which eventually shot off into the distance.  The object then ascended to an even higher altitude.  I sat down in my car, and rapidly opened my window.  The object was still visible.  I pulled out my phone and called my mother.  As she answered, I told her that I was seeing my first U.F.O. ‚Äì and being a scientist, I wanted to rule out natural phenomena.  I mentioned the helicopter idea, but we both shot that down.  I mentioned an airplane ‚Äì not likely.  A balloon?  It rose too quickly.  We couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  Then, as if on cue, a helicopter appeared from behind the hospital.  It passed through the general area where I had originally seen the unidentified object.  This was clearly a helicopter, it was smaller than the object, I could see the red and white paint, and I could make out the unmistakable sounds of the rotors.  It was a perfect controlled comparison.  Next, I was able to see a passenger airplane pass in the distance.  The shape, size, and sound were unmistakable.  Another perfect controlled comparison.  The object was still visible, a mere pinprick of bright light, moving slowly back and forth in the high atmosphere, reflecting sunlight every few seconds.  Suddenly, the object faded from view.  A few seconds later, I viewed a jet approaching the area where the object had been.  I could easily see the wings and shape of the aircraft, although I couldn‚Äôt make out the exact type.  The jet proceeded on its course then it disappeared on the horizon.  I waited a few more minutes, and the object appeared again.  Only for a few seconds, it quickly enlarged in size and then shrank off into the distance and disappeared for good.  It was 16:22 when I last saw the object.  I have no explanation for the events of this afternoon, although I can definitely say that the object was not a conventional aircraft.

     "text":"Hovering, flickering light in the sky that moved erratically I came home around 3:20AM, parked my car and went up to bed. The blinds were open and I was lying there, looking out the window. The clouds were low on the horizon, over the tree line and only to the right of my view. The rest of the sky was black and the stars were visible. Off to my left, over the tree line and definitely very far off, I saw a round orb of bright light that seemed to hover, flicker and change color. I thought it was just a pretty star until it moved up and to the left. I continued watching it and it would hover in one place, then move slowly, almost lazily, in an erratic pattern but staying in the same general area. I know it was moving because at one point, it dipped below the tree line and I could still see it's brightness through the branches, then it would reappear above the tree line. The light was bright and orb-shaped with a flickering quality to it. It seemed to change colors, but as if it was covered with several different lights - like a Christmas tree. It would also fade and disappear completely and then reappear. Again, there was no cloud cover in that part of the sky and I could clearly see the stars out. This continued for 40 minutes and the light seemed to hover and move erratically in the same general area. I wanted to get a camera or something, but I was too afraid. I will look for it again and try to get some video or pictures of it.",

The front of my home faces east and it is located about twenty five miles west of the Atlantic ocean and about eighty miles north of Cape Canaveral. As I gazed up at the moon, I observed a dark, elliptical shaped object silently pass in front of the moon, almost blotting it out, and then disappear in the cloud cover.  I was able to view the object for approximately two seconds, as it crossed south to north.  It was hard to gauge its size, but the impression I was left with was that the object was very large; it was oval shaped in the middle, but the ends were blunt, or square. I quickly dismissed the object as being an aircraft because it had no wings or navigation lights.  The object was completely blacked out.  It was several days before I mentioned the sighting to my wife, who met my revelation with a very perplexed expression.  We‚Äôve been married for twenty three years and she served twenty of my twenty one years in the Marine Corps married to me, not to mention the past seven years that I have been a police officer, and my wife knows I am not easily impressionable, prone to exaggeration, or likely to joke about such things. Occasionally I have caught glimpses of shuttle launches from my front yard, but I truly cannot explain what it was that I saw that night in February.",

While we didn‚Äôt see any meteors, what we saw will probably stick with us for a long time. At about 10:15 that night, one of us noticed a very bright, very low-flying orange ‚Äúthing‚Äù just above the tree line of the eastern shore of the reservoir (see above). Beyond the reservoir to the east is a state park called ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Den.‚Äù It is named as such, according to the Darien Times, because charcoal makers in the hilly, rocky area would say that a hoof-like mark made in a boulder was the footprint of the Devil. It took about 20 minutes for us to become convinced that this was something that we should take pictures of. Once the camera was up and running, the lights remained hovering for about 10 minutes, according to time stamps taken from the camera that took the pictures below. The orange light hovered above the trees moving in an erratic, ‚Äújerky‚Äù fashion. Near the end of its visibility, it began moving purposefully towards the south, where it disappeared beyond a grove of pine trees that blocked our view.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî This is not the first time these lights have been reported by observers. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   (For the record, I am a newspaper reporter who works for a chain of newspapers that includes the newspapers that have covered Redding, Easton, and Weston for a long, long time. No one working at these papers, including the publisher, had ever heard of anything like that which I show below. However, research like this is my job, and I stand behind the information I present to you. But, I cannot guarantee the veracity of the reports listed below. In my opinion, the chances of this many separate reports of similar incidents in one small part of Connecticut over a vast period of time is more than a coincidence.)  As far back as 1966, a Doctor from Darien, Conn. driving past the reservoir noticed lights that seem to match the description of what we had seen.  His report was chronicled by the Spartanburg, SC Herald-Journal. There are also multiple matches for what we saw recorded in the National UFO Reporting Center.  Below I partially quote one entry from Feb. 22, 2011:  ‚ÄúLast night at 8pm I looked out my living room window and noticed a flashing bright red light low on the horizon a mile or so away over the Devil‚Äôs Den area on the Weston/Redding border.  It was low in the sky and unusually bright, much brighter than any airplane lights, flashing and drifting very slowly.‚Äù  And another partial quote from Sept. 28, 2010 in Redding:  ‚ÄúI saw a bright light that slowly moved through the sky and seemed to have striations that looked like lightning bolts eminating from it.‚Äù  And another partial from Weston in Feb. of 2003:  ‚ÄúBright light in sky. Not an airplane because it didn‚Äôt move.  Not a star because it was twinkling white, green and red lights. To the left was another star-like light that seemed to blink a few times then stop‚Ä¶blink again a few time then stop, etc.  After 5 mins. or so both lights grew dimmer and more distant until they were gone.‚Äù  And another from Norwalk in August of 2007:  ‚ÄúBlinking Bright Star/object, at lower altitude than normal at stand still/ moving very subtully through the night sky.  The UFO appeared to be a a blinking star or a plan.   As I laid down in the bed it was descending in a weird fashion.‚Äù   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Our Location ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî   Below are three maps which show our location, our line of site, and the location of the floating object.  The blue lines represent the opening through which we viewed the orange light.  We were only able to witness the light‚Äôs movement between the island you see to the left of our line of site (respective to the observer) and the tall pine trees which cover the peninsula to our right. You can find the same maps at: https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zwGJfJDQECZY.k7Uby7nJpcsQ    Visibility maps. Visibility maps.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî The images ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  That night, I was lucky enough to have my Canon Rebel T3i in the car that brought us to the reservoir. I had taken some 30&#8243; exposure shots before the light appeared. All of the images taken that night were in RAW, CR2 format, which can be provided to anyone who might assume they have been ‚Äúphotoshopped.‚Äù  When the light first appeared, we believed we were seeing a plane coming from the east, rising very slowly.  However, compared to other planes that very regularly fly over the reservoir at night, it was moving far too slowly, and too erratically.  To give the lights some context, I took a picture of a plane traveling above the reservoir just after the orange lights disappeared. It is pictured below. http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-presentation-plane-wp.jpg?w=660&h=440   An image of a plane captured above the Saugatuck Reservoir after the orange lights disappeared. An image of a plane captured above the Saugatuck Reservoir after the orange lights disappeared. As one can see, the lights recorded when taking a picture of a plane were regular, and tightly delineated. I was not taking these pictures with a tripod. Any camera shake is negligible, and the lights of the plane are clearly defined. EXIF data and zoom views are included above. Contrarily, the pictures taken of the odd orange lights were not clear or well-defined. The following picture was taken with the exact same EXIF settings, from the exact same point on the reservoir as the plane lights above. Yet, it depicts something much less defined, with varying colors. It almost looks like a hieroglyph. http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-1-presentation.jpg?w=660&h=440   (An image taken of the orange lights seen on Oct. 8 at the Saugatuck Reservoir.)   The next image of the orange lights give a much better perspective of how unbelievably low these lights were hovering above the tree line.  The brightness and contrast have been edited to show a clearer look at the tree line.  Also of note are the green lights which seem to be the source of the orange, glowing lights.  This image is also taken at about half the shutter-speed as the above two images, and appears to show the eratic nature of the light‚Äôs movement across the sky. http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-presentation-2.jpg?w=660&h=989   A third image of the lights again shows the clear difference between the green and orange lights in the sky, though the human eye could only pick up the green.  When we saw it without a camera lens, the light appeared to be an orange circle floating across the sky.  http://chrisburnswriting.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/alien-3-presentation.jpg?w=660&h=440   An image that shows the orange lights in the sky   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Conclusion ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  I cannot even pretend to guess what on earth I took a picture of that night.  Maybe its a lighted kite for all I know.  All I can do is give you the information I have seen and found, and let you make your own conclusions. I‚Äôm the furthest thing from a skeptic when it comes to this sort of thing, so I urge you to debunk anything I say as harshly as you can. My fellow observers and I are excited to see what you all may think.   Feel free to contact us at [Email removed/cms/tg]",

     "text":"5-6 red globes hovering, then just disappeared Me and my cousin were driving back to school, when all of a sudden I looked out the window and saw about 5-6 red globes in the sky. We were heading North, so we would have seen the objects in a easterly direction from where we were. We were on a long, dark road, and there were no other cars around. I immediately told my cousin to pull the car over, and we watched the objects for about 2 minutes before they disappeared. It didn‚Äôt seem like they flew away, they just vanished. While we were watching the objects, they seemed to stay in an ellipse formation, but one of the globes tended to move around. While we were on the road, we pulled over in front of a house and observed these globes at about a 45 degree angle. Although upstate NY is very hilly, the area we were at was surrounded by fields, and we could see forever. There is no doubt in my mind that this/these objects were in the sky and not on the ground. The objects in the sky were red, or giving off a red glow, were it was the most red on the outer part, and it seemed to get lighter in the middle of each little ball. Besides the red globes, we couldn‚Äôt make out a defined shape of object, just this little cluster of these 5-6 red balls. I don‚Äôt know if it was a coincidence or not, but as soon as we saw the objects, I tried to make a phone call, and my phone wouldn‚Äôt work. The area always has service, so it wasn‚Äôt a dead spot, but my phone wouldn‚Äôt connect. The sky was very clear that night, and the moon seemed to light up everything. Central NY seems to be a high traffic area for airplanes, as they are seen flying over all the time, and at the time we saw this, there were a few planes in the air. There is no possibility that what we saw was an airplane.  These red balls were much bigger that any plane lights could have been, and based on the distance we approximated, there is no way a plane could be that big or move like they did. Although it didn‚Äôt seem like the whole group was moving, like I said earlier, it seemed like one of them w! as movin g.

     "text":"Large Chevron UFO flying over Key Largo FL from the SW to NE - Dear Mr. Davenport, I submitted my Sighting Description late last night and I am sorry, I made many grammatical errors. I went through my paper and have corrected them all. Hello My name is ((name deleted)) and I observed for approximately 10 seconds, in great clarity, in extremely close proximity, a  very, very large chevron shaped unidentified flying object that flew completely from one horizon towards my position, virtually  directly over my head, to the opposite horizon until I could no longer see it, on August 3rd, 2011 in Key Largo Florida at  approximately 11pm at night. My Background:  I was born in May of 1964 and raised in the Metro Detroit area.  I graduated from Western Michigan University in 1990.  I left the  Metro Detroit area and moved to Kansas City in September of 1996, and then finally re-located to Cape Coral, Florida in  September of 2000 where I reside today.  My occupation was in the restaurant/hospitality industry for most of my life and left that  behind when I became self-employed in March of 2004 as a Realtor in SW Florida. As a young man growing up during the Apollo era, I have always had an interest in aviation, space flight, the planets, the moon  and the stars.  I became so interested in astronomy at a young age that my parents gave me a telescope for Christmas when I  was 9 years old.  I still have a 900mm telescope today, although it doesn't get used all that often anymore. At any rate, I have  observed the Moon and its mesmerizing  countless craters countless times.  I have visited Mars, Jupiter, Saturn with my telescope as well and their observable moons and gazed at the Horse Head Nebula, many stars and variety of other celestial objects. Needless to say, I enjoy starring out into space and contemplating all of the greatest questions that confound mankind.  I am  always amazed that I am not seeing a picture of the present stars, but rather looking at a picture of the past stars, and of course its endless beauty.  In addition, through the years I have read books on astronomy, aviation and expanded my knowledge through  college academic's in calculus, physics and astronomy. I am an aviation buff as previously mentioned, I have attended many aviation shows over the years and I can say that I am  probably more familiar with civilian and military aircraft than the average Joe on the street.  My son has been to 10 shows with me,  and he is now 12 years of age.  I have seen just about every type of current military aircraft that civilians are allowed to see, on the ground up close, as well as performing maneuvers for the crowd over the tarmac. To finish the context of my background that is important for you to understand regarding how and why I was privileged enough to  witness this event, I must tell you a story of my past. One evening about 16 or 17 years ago I was laying in the grass at a rest  area with my then wife, outside the city of Detroit, to avoid the city lights. We were there, late night picnicking to observe a  meteor shower that we had discovered was happening, from a radio news broadcast we had heard a couple of days earlier. We  watched many shooting stars that evening, and noticed a bunch of small moving stars. We realized those slow moving stars were  not stars at all, they were satellites. Unexpectedly, I had found a new hobby that night, starring at the sky, in one direction for  long periods of time, then finding and watching satellites cross the sky. I thought that was so cool, to see something so small, so  far away, flying at 17, 500 miles per hour! It just brought me a little closer to outer space!  So, over the years while camping or at the beach, on the darkest of nights when the stars were at their brightest, my son and I  have laid on the ground and looked for satellites together many times. This night, last Wednesday, August the 3rd 2011 was not  our first time satellite gazing. The Event:  My son Julian and I went to Key Largo, Florida on Tuesday August 2nd, 2011 for a two and a half day get-a-way, to celebrate the  end of his summer vacation. 7th grade was starting that follow Monday, so we had planned on doing some snorkeling and fishing. Basically just goofing around and relaxing really.  So, on Tuesday morning we left for the ((name deleted)) Inn located at 97xxx   Hwy, MM 97.8 Bayside, Key Largo, FL 33037  Phone: (305) ((deleted))FAX: (305) ((deleted)). We arrived in the early afternoon,  check into the hotel and met up with some old friends. Then we proceeded to have a fun evening talking, walking on the small  dock and beach at the hotel and eventually went out to dinner that evening. On Wednesday, August 3rd, 2011, we got up in the morning and went to the beach again. I ended up doing most of the real  snorkeling and attempted to do some spear fishing. ((name deleted)) spent most of that morning and afternoon tooling around the real  shallow waters close to the beach with just his goggles on.  Later in the afternoon I met a lady, a guest of the hotel, who was  drinking a beer in the hotel beach waters relaxing.  She talked about this and that, and went on and on, but the two things I  remembered from our short conversation was that she was from northern Florida, and the night before, Tuesday (when we were  out to dinner) she and her husband had been shark fishing off of the little dock at the hotel, and they had done pretty well  catching a few nice sized sharks.  Well, I knew at that moment that Julian and I would be doing some shark fishing that night. It  sounded fun, it was convenient and - well - I wanted to catch a shark too!   That night at about 10:15pm, Julian and I headed to the dock with 2 fishing rods fitted with metal leaders, a fishing tackle box, 4  cans of dog food for shark chum and a box of thawed squid for bait. When we arrived at the Dock there were other people their. The lady from northern part of Florida (she was already fishing) and her son, a new female guest of Latino origin, and another  child I believed to be her son. So in total, there were 3 adults and 3 children. It was a beautiful evening almost completely clear  with a sporadic cloud now and again, but virtually clear. The two ladies were chit chatting away about this and that, the 2 other  boys were playing behind me. I wasn't really paying close attention to any of them at this time, as ((name deleted)) and I were setting our  gear down and getting ready to fish. Julian and I prepared our fishing rods. I went ahead and opened the cans of dog food and  threw the food into the water to bring the sharks closer to the shore. I then baited both fishing rods, each with one full squid and I cast the baits out into the Gulf of Mexico.  At that point, I asked Julian if he wanted to look for satellites and he said sure. So, Julian  and I laid down on the dock to begin looking, starring into the heavans...  NOTE: The docks shape is square and approximately 40'  X 40' and its orientation is such that if you were sitting at the end of the dock, on the edge, with your feet in the water, looking  straight out, you would be facing just about dead NW.  This is where I had cast our fishing rods out into the water. So when we  laid down on our backs, our feet were facing dead NW, with our heads pointed just about due SE. Starring up at the zenith of the sky only after a few minutes, we spotted a tiny red dot, a satellite emitting this faint light, like a  faint star, but crossing the night sky.  As we watched it cross the sky, suddenly one of our fishing rods exploded with the fishing  line running out of the real at a very fast rate! We both jumped up to our feet, I pulled the rod out of it's holder and handed it to  my son.  The 2 other boys came running up to us to watch, and the 2 ladies were there already chit chatting away, now standing  next to us watching the fishing battle. Julian was wrestling with a fiend from the deep and he was loving it.  I had to take the rod  from him a few times to ensure the fish wouldn't wrap himself around a buoy and dock a couple of times, but ((name)) did most of  the work and pulled up to the dock a 4.5 foot Lemon shark. We tried to land the shark as the lady from northern Florida said she  wanted to keep it, but while I was trying to take the hook out of it's mouth and not get bitten at the same time, the shark shook  it's head and jumped off the hook. It fell into the gulf waters and swam off. I asked my son to grab another squid from the box, and I re-baited the fishing rod and cast the bait back out into the Gulf of Mexico. The shark having swam off and the excitement over for the moment, ((name deleted)) began to hangout with the 2 other boys on the dock  behind me playing and talking. The were walking around the dock, then off the dock to the beach and back again to the dock  etc. The ladies still standing 5 feet away from me off to my right, went back into their conversation chit chatting away... I laid  down on the dock, back into my satellite hunting position.  My feet again pointing about due NW and my head about due SE.  The  lady from northern Florida still fishing as well. I starred straight up into the sky looking for movement in the stars, looking for  another satellite to show my son. As the ladies were talking, the Latino lady mentioned something about God and the stars and heavan and then mentioned  something about the North Star, at that juncture I interjected in their conversation and I pointed out to them, how you could find  the North Star by looking at the two stars on the end of the cup of the Big Dipper.  I told them to find the Big Dipper, and then the  2 stars at the end of the cup and showed them how they pointed like an arrow to the North Star...  They didn't seem impressed,  So I laid back down on the dock looking straight up, looking and looking for another satellite to show Julian and his new friends... This went on for about 30 minutes with no luck spotting another satellite. I then caught movement out of the corner of my left eyes' peripheral vision.  Still lying flat on my back, I simply turned my head to  the left (looking just about due SW) and to my amazement I clearly saw a large, and I mean large, flat black object approaching  me, us, quickly.  If I had to judge the objects altitude at the moment I first saw it, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon (or  about a fist and a half at arms length).  The objects physical width was about a fists width across.  It was approaching fast, that's  why I noticed it. It blocked out the star light as it was moving.  Although I had been looking straight up all of this time, my eyes  were wide open and in-tune to the ambient light, so it was easy to see. I leaped to my feet (my entire body has goose bumps as I  am writing this - remembering) - I leaped to my feet, pointed directly at it and started yelling \"look, look, look, look, look, look,  look, at that!!! look, look, look, look, look, look, look, at that!!!\" I was yelling, keeping my finger pointed straight at the craft as it  approached, so that everybody who had not been looking up, could focus on it, could find what it was I was seeing approaching  us in the sky.  It was moving quickly, straight, straight towards us, heading to be almost perfectly above us.... I wasn't paying attention to  anyone else so I really don't know what everybody elses locations were around me... all I could do was stare as it approached  very quickly, and I am yelling to everyone, I see it has lights underneath it. Not a lot of lights, maybe 5 or 6, white lights not too  big, kind of small actually, not flashing, but on - constant and white, they kind of look like the stars, running along the center line  of what I see, as it approaches - clear as if it were in day light - to be a chevron craft, huge, as it passes above me - it's size, its  wing span (for lack of a better definition) was... if you held your hands up to the sky and spread them apart 3 feet apart.  The  wings are perfectly symmetrical, the width from the leading edge to the lee ward edge was a fists width, the ends were square or  45 degree angles, they were not rounded like a boomerang.  It looks like a perfect chevron, with lights running across the center  line of the craft equidistant from each other.  It's was huge - it's the size of a cruise ship in Key West. The real creepy part - it doesn't make a sound - I can't even hear wind  running over the body of it. I'm thinking \"it's not silent, it's more than silent - nothing - no sound - Just me yelling as it's passing  over head - almost as if it were suppressing the sound - as it passes above us I start say \"Do you see that?  What is it? Oh my God  what is that.....Do you see that!\"  It's moving away - never slowing, never buffeting, no lights blinking - no sound - it's past me  moving away - NO EXHAUST... It has no exhaust, no sound... I'm yelling - \"look there\", pointing at it, never taking my eyes off of  it, as I hear the boys come running up. It's approaching a cloud to the NE... I'm yelling at the boys to look hard before it  disappears \"look, look...it's going above that cloud, look at the other side of the cloud maybe you will see it when it comes out the  other side....\" and it was gone. It never slowed - it never turned - it passed almost directly above us, just so it's right wing tip was at the sky's zenith above me  and it's left wing tip directly away from me to the NW. It was flying on a course following the island from the SW to the NE. After the experience, the Latino lady left quickly, I never saw her again a long with the boy that was with her. The other boy, the  northern Florida lady's son couldn't stop talking about it, what he saw, over and over again. I was dumb founded. I just shook my  head head and could not understand what I had just seen. The feeling reminds me of when I was told my older brother had died. I  didn't go into shock like frozen or start crying, I just was amazed, dazed. I ask everyone did you see that?... and everyone said  yes, but there answers washed over me - I went into shock by going about my business.... I checked the fishing lines, lit a  cigarette and laid down on the dock, looking at the sky. I ask Julian if he had seen it and he said he yes he had... I started thinking \"was it a B-2 bomber? Could a B-2 bomber be flying that low? Why would a B-2 bomber being flying that low?? I  know B-2's are REALLY quiet, but could one fly that low and be SILENT?? No, it wasn't a B-2, when it flew over head it was a  chevron shape, didn't have the \"bat\" look with the B-2's \"W\" shaped tail end. There were no red and green navigation lights, just  the white lights across the center line or the entire mid line of the chevron shape...my mind was spinning... I went to our hotel  room, made a rum and coke and went back out to the dock. 15 - 20 minutes had passed. I laid back down on the dock, looking at  the sky, by the fishing rods smoking a cigarette. I asked the northern Florida lady, \"did you see that thing?\" that's all I could say... I couldn't even have an intelligent conversation about it, I had to have been in shock now that I look back. I didn't even have the  sense to ask for the northern Florida ladies phone number. Why? I'm an intelligent person??  Around midnight Julian and I packed it up and went back to our hotel room and we went to sleep. The next morning we had to  drive back to Cape Coral. I had some work to do with a client on Friday, and I wanted to make sure Julian was all set for Monday  morning school. On the ride home I called and told one of my best friends and told him what happened and what I had seen. He  fully believed me, but after I hung up with him, I thought I best be careful who I talk to about this... Friday, I had to talk to someone and get some answers, so I called the Monroe Sheriffs department, and I told them the basic  story. I asked if anyone had reported seeing an unusual object in the sky around 11pm last Wednesday night flying up the  coastline of Key Largo. The lady officer I spoke with actually took the time to ask around and check if any reports had been filed (I  didn't expect to get that much consideration with the story I had just given her) and she said no, but perhaps I should call  Homestead Air Force Base and see if the were conducting some sort of operations. So I did. I called Homestead Air Force Base and kind of gave the gentleman on the phone the short version like \"I think I saw something  like a B-2 bomber flying low over Key Largo last Wednesday night...\" He said quite plainly and politely that Homestead did not  have any B-2's stationed there. I asked him \"would a B-2 be flying that low over the Island in any event?\" He said that he really  didn't know. So, I called the Key West Naval Air Station to see if they had tracked anything on radar that night. I ended up getting  a message machine in their \"public relations\" department. I left a message asking for someone to contact me, and that I had few  important questions to ask, but no one returned my call... So I told 3 more people over the coarse of the last 5 days. My cousin,  and 2 people at work. I then decided I need to call somebody who knows more about this stuff. I contacted MUFON, and their investigator is out of town. Ann Castle, emailed me and said she would try to be in touch with me  next Monday. That's when I got back on line and found THE NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER. I recognized Mr. Davenport's  name from previous TV shows and articles I have read and decided to leave a message explaining what happened last week. and  there it is... One of the things I keep thinking about over and over was how the object moved and looked as if it were a computer enhanced  image, almost like it was an image projected onto the sky because it was so perfect. It was like watching a space ship in a movie  theater, moving perfectly soundless, never fluttering, never buffeting, moving quickly - steadily, straight, soundless, moving  almost god like. OR, I guess you could say it looked like a ship in space, how once they are moving in a direction, they continue in  that direction unless acted on by another force. That's kind of the way it make me feel every time I reveiw the film in my head. Seemed like nothing was pushing or pulling it, it was just momentum. Maybe that's why there wasn't any sound? Airplanes and  jets tend to dip a wing, make the air move, make some sort of sound... Every time I think of it, I get the goose bumps because  although it was completely absorbing, fantasinating and I feel privileged to have been in the right place at the right time - it was  still really very eerie... One conclusion I have come to: If I was not looking up, I would have never had known it was there. No sound what so ever. It  would have passed right over all of our heads as we looked out on the water and never had a clue. Amazing. I have watched  every aviation program, every UFO program, every Big Foot Program etc...that has ever been broadcast on TV since I was a child. I have always wanted to see a UFO. I have looked at the skies looking for a UFO's for years and years. I never thought I would  really see one. I cetainly never thought to be caught purely by surprize and have one fly so close to me, over head, and to be so  immense. I truely am privileged. It was the most awesome sight I have ever seen next to seeing my son being born!  In conclusion, all I can think is that I hope it's one of ours, because if it is - we have some bad-ass flying machines up there! If it  isn't one of ours, one can only speculate to the possibilities and implications... Thanks for taking the time to read this.  Best  regards, ((name deleted))",

     "text":"Brightly lit, horizon to horizon in 3 seconds, instantaneous acceleration, erratic random maneuvers.  Awesome! I was standing on an open porch of a house (339 fifth Ave West, North Bay, Ontario) facing the street (northeast) at dusk (partly dark) with my friend  having a cigarette.  My brother at this time was in the house in a room directly behind where John and I were standing separated by a large window..  I was chatting with john (both of us facing east) when a brightly lit object flew/shoot directly overhead of us passed through several clouds and cleared the northeast horizon within about 2 seconds, leaving a light tracer similar to a shooting star. John and I had both seen this at the exact same time and turned to each other (still facing east). John said with a bewildered look on his face ‚ÄúI guess we just seen a shooting star ??‚Äù  About 5 seconds later what appeared to be the same object (with the same speed, light tracer and seemingly within the same flight path in reverse) came back from over the northeast horizon traveling now southwest bound. Almost ¬Ω way across the sky it instantly stopped on a dime and hovered there and drifted slowly for about 10 seconds. It then instantly accelerated and started making erratic random 90 and 30 degree turns in every direction without slowing. I recall about 5-7 turns in total within about 10 seconds all within a small local vicinity of where it had initially stopped and hovered. On the last turn it stopped and hovered for about ¬Ω a second then instantly shoot itself over the northeast horizon within a second, again with the same speed, light tracer and within the same flight path in which we had initially seen the object. All of this occurred without a sound. We lost sight of the object over the northeast horizon. My friend, my brother and I were absolutely ecstatic and bewildered after the sighting (it being our first confirmed). Not only were we first hand witnesses to a genuine, unmistakable UFO sighting (one of technological nature) but we were witnesses of a very rare, clear sighting one in which the object clearly violated known laws of physics. All without making a sound. We were very lucky, what were the odds of us being at the right place at the right time. You never forget something like that. I have searched UFO sighting videos ever since this sighting and have only found a few that even compare. I can honestly say I have witnessed something most will likely never get see first hand. Unfortunately at the time none of us had a camera or phone and weren't able to capture it. I also regret that I and or we had not reported it or documented it, exact time and date etc.. At the time I was concerned about the nature of the sighting; occurring in military airspace not to mention d! irectly under the nose of NORAD. I regret letting fear and circumstances at the time deter me from stepping forward. Notes:  -Within the 10 seconds in which the object was hovering I frantically banged on the window to the room in which my brother was in and screamed at him to come out on the porch to see the object. He then quickly came onto the porch and witnessed everything that proceeded. There was an older woman in the room where my brother was that had seen the tail end of the sighting through the window. I cannot confirm exactly how much she seen. We talked about reporting it to NORAD after the sighting but we quickly decided not to out of  fear. I had stayed the night at this address. The next day around 1:00 pm two officers in dress attire came to the house asking about an apparent robbery in the area. Initially seeing them at the door made me very suspicious considering.. My brother and I sky watch whenever we get a chance. Its now almost an automatic habit. I will submit illustrations and maps asap. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

     "text":"A brilliant orange-red light seen flying slowly in the sky above Rose City, Michigan From the backyard of my cottage in Rose City in Michigan, on the 17th of August, about half an hour before midnight, I spotted in the sky, which was cloudless, a brilliant orange-red sphere of light in motion to the west of Rose City.  When I first saw the object, which was larger than all the stars, it was about 40 degrees above the horizon.  Within a few seconds I could tell that it was moving eastward, toward the area where my cottage is.  It did not move in a straight line the entire time that it moved eastward; it strayed a little several times from the course that it was on.  It was completely silent, and the intensity of the light, which was radiant, never noticeably varied.  After a minute or two the object was almost directly above my land; and when it was nearly overhead, it did not look far away: it did not look as high in the sky as commercial planes do when at cruising speed.  It seemed to me to be at an altitude of about 15,000 feet.  It looked about five times larger than all the orbiting satellites that I have seen, and I have seen many satellites.   In fact, at no time did it look like it was in outer-space.  (The only planet visible that night at the time when I saw the object was in the southern part of the sky, and it was probably about 30 degrees above the horizon.  I do not know what planet it was, but I do know from the white color of it that it was not Mars.) When the object was between 40 and 30 degrees above the eastern horizon, it grew invisible in a matter of seconds.  That it was not a blimp is certain.  ...To get an idea of the size of this sphere of light that I saw, get out a Q-Tip and hold it so that only the top half of the head of one of the tips is visible above your thumb and index finger, and then go outside and fully extend your arm up toward the sky.  (By the head of the Q-Tip I mean not just the soft part extending beyond the stem but also the part of the stem that has cotton wrapped around it‚Äîthe ‚Äúneck‚Äù.)   The object looked just a little smaller! than th at. ...By the way, I do not drink alcohol and I do not use drugs of any kind, prescription or illegal.",

     "text":"3 swift moving dark eye-shaped attached segments of shimmering grey/silver fly abreast smoothly change to single file  nnw to w on the evening of august 13, 2010, i was outside observing the sky for the perseid  meteor shower.  i watched as the moon, venus, mars and saturn set in the west.  i observed satellites, commercial and private aircraft, as well as a few meteors.  at the time of this sighting, jupiter was just below the tree line in the east. i have been studying astronomy and the night sky for 20 years.   i know the difference between many of the things people think are ufos, and an actuall unexplainable object in the sky. what i saw friday the 13th, at about 10:25 pm was not explainable. i saw the whole incident through binoculars, with a momentary naked eye glance to verify. the object was in three segments or parts, but they all moved as if they were attached to each other.  they were a smokey grey/silver.  the edges were undefined.  each segment was shaped like an human eye--a tapered oval.  it was not lit but seemed to be either softly reflecting light or softly glowing from the center of each segment.  the center of each segment was lighter or brighter than the darker, undefined outer edges. when i first saw it, the parts were traveling abreast in a westerly direction, and then they manuvered to single file one after the other. they did not turn in any other direction, they just went smoothly from traveling abreast to traveling single file.  the largest segment was closest to me, and stayed in front.  the smallest segment was the center one. the last and farthest segment was sized almost as large as the first.  while changing formation, it did not change traveling direction.  it flew from northeast close to east of where the north star is, and went west just over the handle of the big dipper, on towards arcturus, where i lost it behind some trees.  after losing sight of it, i looked at the time, it was 10:26 pm. comparison--if you have ever seen the andromeda galaxy on a dark clear night--in binoculars, this is what each segment looked like--except darker undefined edges and of course it was moving.  each segment was roughtly the same size as the andromeda galaxy.    the formation took up the space that the plaeides constellation takes up in a binocular view.  although my binoculars are not high quality, they afford me a nice view of the night sky, i can make out the beehive cluster with them, but not something like the rings of saturn or the moons of jupiter.  the binoculars are 12x50, probably better for birding, but they do the job on a nice clear night. the weather was very clear, no clouds, about 72 degree f.  the sky was dark enough in my backyard to see the andromeda galaxy this night (i saw it later that evening). the stars were so clear that it was easy to see anything moving against the starfield, which is why i saw this object. i was facing due north, i has been following 2 satellites which paths had seemed to come quite close together in the northeast.  after they separated, the one i ended up following had faded in the north. this was when i picked up this object moving swiftly through the sky.  it was about 35 degrees off my zenith, traveling west.  it took maybe 10-15 seconds at the most (?) for it to be gone from my view. with north as 12 oclock, it traveled from 1 oclock towards my left (west) past 12, 11, 10 oclock, to about 9 oclock.   it appeared to be in space with the satellites, not close to where conventional aircraft fly.  the speed of travel was much faster than an airliner at 20,000 feet at 5 miles away, faster than any satellite  i have seen cross the sky, but slower than a shooting star crossing my field of view. as i watched, it went behind some treetops momentarily--and i still had no trouble following it.  there was no trail of smoke or exhaust.  all three segments seemed to shimmer or vibrate gently.  the shimmering was more perceptable at the edges of each segment. i have seen geese fly in the moonlight, and this was almost the same, but there were no wings flapping, no honking, no bird shape (no long neck, nothing moving on any segment) and the objects maintained a constant distance from one another like they were firmly attached even when changing formation. there was no attaching structure that i could see, i do not remember seeing stars 'through' or 'between' the segments, althogh if i had, i would have noticed. at this point the crescent moon had set, i suspect that this object was high enough to gather ambient light enough from the same source as our satellites (the sun), and reflect it back. it could have been picking up the glow of the moon below the horizon, or ambient city light glow.   the sight of it also gave me the impression that somehow it was absorbing most of the light, like it was cloaked.  my only other thought on what this was like would be an airplane flying with no lights at all.  it still does not explain the shape of the object, or the apparent formation change during flight. there was no sound, no smell, no vibrations, no strange feelings during this sighting.  i live approximately 6 minutes by commercial air travel from newark airport (25 miles or so by car) and wonder if anything showed on radar (if this thing was low enough).   becouse i am an experienced sky observer, i believe that this is indeed a ufo, unless there are man made crafts that can appear as i have described.  when i first saw this object, i remembered to be as observant as possible and kept in mind real life comparisons for a good description. i have searched the internet for descriptions or videos that are similar.  when i find something i will be in touch.  i am only sorry i did not have my hd camcorder ready, although i am not sure this would have shown up in video without more hi-tech equipment.  i get annoyed at some of the ufo reports that lack in detail, or have poor descriptions. and i want to be as detailed as possible. to demonstrated my observational skills and knowlege: previously, i have seen many things that seemed unexplainable in the night sky.  i came to no conclusions until i thought through what i had seen.  there was a reasonble explanation, no matter how fantastic it seemed at the time.   two of these previous sightings are as follows:  one object i had seen was a very bright round falling object in the southeastern sky in mid october. a peice of it had also fallen away below it like molten silver, i watched it fade after about 5 minutes. it made no noise although it looked like it would hiss like a fire if you could hear it.   it was either a shooting star coming directly at me that broke up into two peices, or a rocket booster falling away after lauch. this occured around 3 am and i was too tired to look it up, but i am sure that is what it was. the other object was a very distant, large bright green flair in a cold winter northeastern sky, a green so brilliant, like the the color green a diamond reflects in the sunlight.  this flair left a trail and it traveled in horizontal fashion, taking much longer than fireworks to fade. there was no sound. this was probably a military flare from a marine vessel (i live close to the waters west of new york city and staten island--close enough to observe a flare from the water there if it was shot high enough). the exact dates of these occurences have long been forgotten, because i knew they were easily explained.  at the time, they were surprising and amazing to see. i am an expereinced amateur sky watcher.  i would like to point out that i know the difference between the most obscure explanaions for identifiable objects, and an unidentified flying object.  i have seen almost every kind of non-ufo expample in the day and night sky -- so i do know the difference.  i hope there is some logical explanation for this.  i have never seen anything like this before. ok for preliminary email contact by nuforc investigator.   thanks.",

The object was moving erratically in the sky and was slightly larger than the planet Venus just after dark or just before dawn.  It was about 25 to 30 degrees in the morning sky about 6 to 10 miles away and we were facing south. The digital camera we used was hand held and not on a bipod as we were not expecting to capture anything morning. The weather was clear, no cloud cover, no rain, perfect and cool. The object, as stated earlier, moved erratically for a short time then stopped and hovered for about 5 minutes. The photo numbered 705 is the picture of the object just hovering.  Once stopped we could tell that it was shaped circular like a doughnut with lights of every color around the outside of the craft with a solid center.  After hovering for 5 minutes or so the object took off moving north relatively fast making no sound what so ever. My son and I saw the object and even though we have been looking for it every morning since we have not seen the object again.  I do realize that alot of people try to hoax the public and are out for their 15 minutes of fame.  This is not the case as we want no media what so ever. Just simply an answer for what we have seen in the sky over our home would suffice.  We understand that may not be possible but just knowing somewhere someone has seen something similar would help. We are not nut cases claiming abduction and honestly we have reservations about the people who do.  My son is a 12 yr old 7th grader and i am a building sub-contractor.",

This incident occurred as I was taking out the garbage cans to the street edge at 10:45pm Sunday night. The weather had a slight fog, with a thin layer of clouds covering approximately 50% of the sky. I saw what I initially thought was an aircraft approach from the east at an altitude of approximately 1000-1500ft.  As this object approached closer to my position, I noticed it was giving off a brilliant orange color and had a spherical shape. It had no navigation or running lights (I am a former private pilot) It moved probably no faster than 60mph in my estimation. This object radiated the most brilliant and pure color of orange I have ever seen.  It flickered as it moved, as a road flare flickers when burning. The object emitted no noise whatsoever. It was quite obviously spherical, with no projections anywhere. It made a slow arching turn from its initial flight path right toward where I was standing, slowed and then stopped almost nearly directly above me (staying at ~1500ft altitude).  The object hovered for no more than a few seconds.  Suddenly, this object flew straight up punching a hole directly through the cloud layer (est. 2000 ft) above it.  It flew to an altitude to where it was a pinpoint in less than 2 seconds. Notes/Impressions:  - Aircraft flight patterns in my area are generally from the the South to North (To/from SeaTac airport)  - This \"object\" I witnessed came from the east (from over Tacoma proper) which is unusual in my area unless it is a military aircraft from McChord AFB  - There was a few aircraft flying in the area at the time of this incident.  I would say there is a good chance a pilot flying in the area saw this object.  - Other people in my area at the time must have seen it.  The glow was quite brilliant.  - I got the impression it \"knew\" I was looking at it.  - The color of orange this thing emitted was extremely \"pure\" like coherent light from a laser - ie. the pure red or green you see from a laser. Not like an aircraft navigation light.  - The faster it moved the more it seemed to \"flicker\"  - I am aircraft/military buff and can recognize most civilian and military aircraft.  I have never seen an object like this one. It flew outside the performance envelope of any aircraft I have known about.",

     "text":"Red fireball UFOs over South Carolina in controlled flight to a northerly direction seen south of Columbia On the night of March 28, 2009 I was driving on I26 going west, just south of Columbia, South Carolina.  I had just spent an hour at a roadside rest area and slept for an hour before continuing on my trip.  Not long after continuing my drive, suddenly I saw what looked like a circular shaped glowing ball of fire. About the size of a Frisbee it flew in toward me out of the western sky. In the total darkness, I could not judge how high up it was. I marveled at it as it flew directly overhead and followed it threw my sun roof.  I did not think of it as a UFO because I kept thinking about how this thing resembled a bright red and orange amber in a fire.  The inside of the circle sparkled with white flashes as the orange color graduated to a cooler red at the perimeter.  The outside of the circle was not well defined and wavered slightly. I did not think of it as a UFO because I had a preconception, from what I so often have heard, that UFOs are glowing white lights in the sky at night.  I also never really believed that there were such things as UFOs. As fast as I could, I crossed over two lanes on the interstate, stopped on the side, opened the sun roof, and stuck my head out to continue looking at this fireball.  To my surprise I saw yet another similar object approaching from the east on a collision course with the first. When they were relatively close to each other, they both made sharp turns to the north.  They continued flying in formation until they disappeared in the horizon.  I was driving a hybrid car so the car engine was completely silent and no traffic was on the highway at this moment. Yet I could not detect any noise from these objects in the sky.  I have seen thousands of aircraft in the sky and live near an airport, so there is no mistaking these items for airplanes. Shortly after these items had disappeared into the horizon, I witnessed what I thought at first was a shooting star. However, as I thought about it, it dawned on me that this could not have been a coincident. This beam of light, coming from space, intersected the pathway of the two flying objects. It appeared to me that if this beam of light had appeared ten, fifteens seconds earlier, it would have been right on top of these objects or even possibly hit one of them. It is also worth noting that these UFOs were in this geographic location on the same day that the shuttle landed at Cape Kennedy.  The shuttle landed at 3:14 pm and this sighting occurred at 11:45 pm. I realize that these occurrences are many hours apart, but never the less it is on the same day and only a few hundred miles apart.

     "text":"W-shaped erratically flying at low level is \"unidentified\" with anything prior seen in thousands of flight hours. The Tempe Arizona sky was clear with many stars and planets visible and moon at 74% illumination. Suddenly at very low level (just above tree tops) a flight was observed moving from southwest to northeast, proceeding in a \"rounded\" zig-zag pattern with quick turns and slight variations in altitude. Initially it looked like a blurry/hazy white \"W\" and I wondered if it were an owl initially.  As it quickly came closer it clearly was not a flight of birds or bats not an identifiable bird; and the \"W\" resemblance was assured, moving with the \"W\" parallel to the ground and moving toward the two points at the bottom of the W.  No typical banking maneuvers were noticed, meaning the object did bank and/or pitch up, just not with the co-ordination nor symmetry associated with fixed-wing aircraft nor fowl. As it neared, still flying erratically, the object looked a muted white even translucent.  The \"W\" was not with sharp lines/edges, rather more rounded and muted/hazy with visible striations fore to aft along its entirety every 5% or so.  The flying \"W\" appeared as one unit, no flapping, no noticeable moving parts, no exhaust or trail of any sort, no lights nor glowing and no noise. The object proceeded to nearly overhead the open patio and as I stood up it quickly altered course and went over/behind a 30' tree (which provided perspective & parallax, so I report it at low level). I walked over under the tree and observed the object completing a turn back toward the tree. As I walked toward it, it turned away and proceeded back on a zig-zagging northeasterly track.  Observer has seen some very large white owls in Arizona, and this was not that.  If it was organic, nothing distinguished it as such.  Observer had previously observed what were deemed \"The Phoenix Lights\" on more than one occasion, including during daylight hours.  This \"W\" is quite unlike those phenomena.   Observer's background includes many thousand hours of commercial piloting experience.",

It was very far away and all we had to magnify with was a pair of binoculars. In the binoculars it appeared as a pinpoint (orb) and was very far but closer than a star appears in binoculars.  When it went below the tree line we drove to a local field to continue to observe it.  It was still there but appeared to have move further south.  It was still too far away for us to be able to clearly identify it.  The area this object would have been observed is the Gulf of Mexico, west coast of Florida, around the Cedar Key area.",

     "text":"8/13/13 Three UFOs were spotted over Las Vegas, each object changed shape. The following incident occurred on August 13, 2013, at 2:00 AM, Pacific Coast Time.  The location was along the road going to Mount Charleston, in the vicinity of Las Vegas, Nevada. Two witnesses were parked along the road.  They were observing a recent meteor shower.  They were looking north, away from the city lights of Las Vegas.  Only a few meteors were spotted.  They came from the northeast direction.  Each meteor sighting lasted for about a second. However, a bright white light approached from the southeast.  It was in the shape of an orb.  Another object red orb shaped object appeared nearby.  Both objects moved towards the west over the Las Vegas skyline.  Both objects emitted an aura, or a haze, which was changing shape.  At various times, each object stopped and hovered still.  These events occurred until 2:30 AM. At 2:30 AM, the red orb shaped object disappeared.  It immediately reappeared about 25 miles to the southeast, about one second later.  It remained stationary for another half hour.  During this time period, the larger White shaped orb moved to the east.  It changed into a diamond shape.  Immediately thereafter, it changed into a triangular shape, with three bright lights in each corner.  This occurred for about 10 minutes, until it disappeared. Both witnesses returned to Las Vegas by 3:30 AM.  They were standing in a cul-de-sac observing the night sky.  At this time, the large white orb reappeared, coming from the northeast.  Two red orbs appeared nearby.  The large white orb changed into a boomerang shape.  It came closer to the neighborhood where the two witnesses were standing on the cul-de-sac.  The boomerang shaped object had bright white lights along each section or wing.  It approached even closer, and it remained stationary, hovering about 500 feet above the ground.  The two red orbs moved closer to this boomerang shaped object, hovering at about 600 feet above the ground.  By this time, the boomerang object emitted a beam of white light which was scanning from the left to right, and back again. However, the two red orbs each focused a red beam of light down into the cul-de-sac.  Following this, the red beams of light completely engulfed a house on the cul-de-sac.  The red beams of light created a red, green, yellow, and white spherical haze around the house.  The spherical haze had holographic properties, however it was difficult to ascertain definite shapes within the holographic properties.  This holographic type ball of light continued to change colors.  Then it stopped. Both witnesses continued to observe the three unidentified flying objects.  At 3:45 AM, witness number one decided to ‚Äú signal‚Äú these three objects in the following manner:  Witness number one held his left  arm up and made three blinking motions with his left hand.  Then he paused for a second, held up his right arm, and made a single up and down motion, followed by a short pause, and continuing with four horizontal motions.  Continuing, the first witness walked in a circle.  The first witness did this to symbolize the number pi, as a universal mathematical constant, and to show its relationship to circles.  The first witness repeated this series of motions two more times, for a total of three times. Immediately thereafter each object transformed into disks.  The first object had three green lights on the underside.  These lights made a circular pattern, and rotated counter clockwise three times.  This was followed by a flash of bright white light. Continuing, four bright red lights appeared in a circular fashion.  They rotated clockwise, making four circular motions.  This entire pattern was repeated by the second object.  After this pattern was completed by the second object, the same exact and entire pattern was repeated by the third object.  This was also done again, in the same manner, two more times, for a total of three times.  By 3:00 AM, the first object changed into a boomerang, hovering for several minutes until it vanished.  The next two objects changed back into red orbs, and shortly thereafter, they also disappeared.",

We lived along a backwater area full of trees that separated us from rte 231.  My wife, two kids, and I saw a black boomerang shaped craft move northward, silently in a very controlled straight line just along the tree tops at about as fast as a person would walk, actually caressing the tree tops on the eastern side of 231. It was still light out though heading into twilight. It then stopped about 40 feet from our house (just on the other side of the adjacent street) and hovered motionless for maybe 2 minutes, like it was parked. We watched it from our back porch.  I have 20 20 vision, and could see that there were fairly sharp angled surfaces that appeared to have a rough surface similar to velcro. This much reminded me of some known stealth technology, however there was no sign of any means of propulsion. It was about 40 or 50 feet across (wingspan) and about only 4 feet in heig! ht, not high enough for someone to stand, or hardly even sit - if it were manned a person would probably have to be lying down. I was trying to image how it was being flown.  Maybe it was unmanned?  There were no motors and no jets, no sound or light coming from it. It was all black. I told my wife to run in and get the video camera, and as she went in, it moved straight upward several thousand feet within a minute or two, by the time she returned. We turned on the video camera and captured about 30 seconds of video before the battery died, but by then it was thousands of feet up and it looks like some little black boomerang in the sky (and as a jet liner files past it, probably a few thousand feet above it, it flexed one of its wings while the other remained more or less stationary). Then it kept rising until it was out of sight. Having seen it up close I know it was not a balloon or some inflated thing, though it was apparently flexible to some extent. It was quite solid ap! pearing when close up. My 7 year old son actually exclaimed \"m! aybe the re are aliens inside!\". I laughed a little nervously said, \"maybe, who knows?\". At first I thought it might be one of ours, but I didn't think it would be very typical for a top secret ultra high tech craft to be flying around close to the ground in a residential neighborhood? Unfortunately I don't still have my video - I gave it to a friend where I used to work who was a 'ufo enthusiast' and who told me he had seen many ufos while living in Arizona as a kid. He had told me he had seen many spherical colored objects flying over their neighborhood at several thousand feet in broad daylight, often being chased by jets (in the 60s?).

I was asleep in my room then awoke and felt like I immediately needed to get up and do something so I got up to go smoke a cigarette in my garage because it had been cold outside for the past two weeks but as I got closer to the garage door I heard a voice in my head say &quot;YOU NEED TO GO OUTSIDE&quot; So, I said speaking a pond what I had just heard&quot;YOUR RIGHT LET ME GO OUTSIDE&quot; so I turned around and went out my back door and as I stepped out the door I noticed that the sky was crystal clear it appeared as if every star in the sky was visible. As I looked to the left I saw what appeared to be something like a rainbow it was purple and pink and it sat right above a tall tree in my neighbor's back yard. It looked like a snakes body when it slithers but not going from West to East but from South to Nor! th above the tall tree and it also appeared as if it was transparent so I said to my self thinking what is that I've never seen that before. Then I looked off to the right of me still scanning the sky hoping I would see a UFO but I didn't so I turned back to look at the strange colors thinking I'm going to watch whatever this is to see if it disappears or fades away and as soon as my eyes locked on the strange colors a circular ball of light surrounded by a neon green and blue gas or plasma substance which stayed around the helicopter sized craft the entire time shot out at super sonic speed and made a complete stop the craft hovered for app 10 seconds and then started to move really really slow to the right of me for about 7 to 10 seconds before shooting off in super sonic speeds without making a sound and left behind 6 circles that look like smoke rings with lines in between each of them. As I turned my head the object appeared to be coming back in the opposite direction ! except this time it appeared to be far out with the stars and ! traveled out as far as I could see within 5 seconds so by this time i was crying like a baby because I couldn't believe what had just happen to me so I stepped up on my stairs to the house and looked up to the sky and asked &quot;GOD IF THAT WAS MEANT FOR ME AND IF YOU MEANT FOR ME TO SEE THAT WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW ME ANOTHER SIGN? And as soon as I said that a smaller circular ball of light flew right over my house lower than the UFO with noun of the same characteristic as the UFO except for how bright and illuminated they both were.  couldn't handle it any more so while still crying and in complete shock I went in my room and laid down and felt such a sense of peace that I had a smile on my face from ear to ear and it felt like I was dying and leaving my body then I blacked out within a minutes or less saying oh my GOD oh my GOD. Then I woke up around 10:30am the next morning looking around thinking OK I'm in my room and I jumped up thinking to my self oh my GOD that really did happen to me last night so while in the shower I felt a bump underneath my right arm pit and quickly got out the shower to look at whatever it was knowing that it hadn't been there the morning before or months before or years prior to the event that took place last night. The bump appeared to have a oval black burn mark in the center. The bump went down after two years but now you can clearly see a whole and what appears to be an object perfectly placed in the center where the black mark once was. It is still underneath my arm as ! of this day and it is going on 6 years now. It appeared as if I was burnt by a laser or injected with a hot needle at first but now it appears as if I was implanted with something that Dr Roger Leir studies but it has never caused me any discomfort. All I want is some help so I can understand what happen to me that night. This is my honest to GOD truth. I also have a picture of the mark that's underneath my arm and two picture's I took of a UFO on my birthday March 27 of 2009",

Two nights ago my girlfriend and I were on our way back from Columbia, Missouri and traveling south on Hwy. 63. As we were approaching Ashland, Missouri we noticed four bright yellowish white lights spaced evenly with a red light in the middle that were very low in the sky. The lights were constant brightness except for the red light which appeared to dim at random times. At first we thought it was a plane because there was an airport near by and we thought it was so low (about 150 to 200 yards above us) because it was about to land. But then we realized that we had already past the airport about 3 miles ago. As we got closer we realized the craft appeared to hover and was moving to slowly for it to stay in the air. There was also no sound like that of a helicopter and was also to big to be a helicopter. If I had to guess its size I would have to say it was about 70 yards wide and was symmetrical in a diamond shape. We turned around and put the pedal to the floor to get a better look at it but by the time we got to where it was it had disappeared. We went on the outer road to see if it had landed somewhere but didn‚Äôt find anything. Then tonight July 2, 2008 I was driving home and from the road by my house you can see across the river to the area where Ashland is. I noticed the same lights and couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes! I put the car in reverse and watched the craft float back and forth for about 4 minutes like it was searching for something (hopefully not me). It was also thunder storming so every time the lightning hit u could see the out line of it. Then all of a sudden the lights almost looked like they disintegrated and lightning hit two more times and there was no outline. The craft had just disappeared. And I‚Äôm not making this up I never really believed in ufos until now and if you knew me you would no I wouldn‚Äôt waste my time to make up a bogus story. It really freaked me out cause I‚Äôve seen it twice in the last 3 nights and the way it disappeared was what really shocked me‚Ä¶ Hopefully some one else will report something so I won‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm completely crazy.",

     "text":"UFO over Blanco River in Wimberley, TX, November 1st, 2015. Unidentified Flying Object Sighting   Date:  November 1st, 2015  Location: Wimberley Texas  Time: Approximately 11:00pm CST  Duration of sighting: 3-5 minutes  Distance:  Less than 1 mile away  Size: Approximately 100 feet in diameter    On the night of November 1st, 2015, around 11:00pm CST, I left the house to go get a pack of cigarettes.  My road, Wayside Dr., when heading into town goes straight down to River Rd. which follows directly along the banks of the Blanco River.  Turning right out of the driveway theres a hill that you go up as soon as you start going down the road.  When I reached the crest of that hill I first saw a light through the trees, that was also obstructed by hills partially as well.   Now since literally the day before, our area was hit once again by severe flooding, especially the Blanco River and its estuaries, for the second time within the past 6 months.  The first flood being the epic Memorial Day flood that was the absolute worst we have on record, causing millions of dollars in damage as well as several deaths.   So since we just experienced another severe flood the day before and there were people still missing, I just thought at that moment first seeing light down by the river it was probably just another helicopter flying over the area.   Driving a little over a mile down my road I finally got to see my first unobstructed view of the object, at the beginning of a short straight away less than a mile away from the river.  Realizing immediately this was not a helicopter or any sort of aircraft I am accustomed to seeing.  It was moving slowly from right to left, pulsating light from bright white to a dim yellowish/orange color and appeared to be flying directly over the Blanco River. So I then promptly grab my cell phone and begin snapping pictures of the object after stopping in the middle of the road, realizing I only had a few seconds before it was going to move behind more trees and would be obstructed again once it moved farther to the left of the clearing I had at that moment.  Once it was obstructed, I continued down the road to try and quickly get to the river so I could possibly get closer, better and more defined pictures of the craft.  Once I got to the bend in the road at the end of the straight away where I took the first two pictures, I had the opportunity to capture two more clear/unobstructed pictures of the object.  Then I sped down to the river as quickly and as safely as I could, the whole time I had limited visual contact with it through the trees but could absolutely still see it moving and pulsing the whole time. Nearing the end of my road where it intersects with River Rd. there are several quick ‚ÄúS‚Äù shaped curves right before you get to the intersection, it was at that point through the trees I could see it was in fact flying right over the river.  The craft was approximately the size of a small house but in an oval/funnel shape, illuminated as well and flying approximately 200 feet above the rivers surface.  There are cliffs on the opposite side of the river from where River Rd. runs that are around 100-150 feet tall and this craft was only about 50 feet above those cliffs.  Then before I could even get to turn down River Rd., which I would have had to turn left to go toward it; the craft flashed extremely bright, shook in place rapidly (like a trembling motion) and shot off unbelievably fast going up in altitude as well as heading Southeast, in the same direction the river flows.  Once it shot off it was totally out of sight with in a second, gone, no sound or any sign of it in ! the distant sky. Unfortunately I was unable to get anymore pictures of the craft before it took off once I got down to the river.  Which I regret not just taking video of it while driving even if it was obstructed by trees, because you still would‚Äôve been able to see its rapid departure through the trees as well as the flash and trembling it did before shooting off.  But the deer in this area make night driving very hazardous and having had several encounters with them on the roads at night here, 2 of them ending in impact right on my road alone and driving our new car (we just bought literally a week before), I was absolutely not going to video tape and drive at the same time. The whole time I was driving down to river from my road, I was hoping and looking for someone else to be on the road.  Thinking someone else could be seeing the same thing.  But that made it even more strange because even after the craft took off from its slow cruise over the river, I did not see a single car on any of the roads on the way to the only 24hr convenience store in town. The whole trip I only passed one car on the way home and that was on the main road that runs through town, Ranch Road 12.  Also since the river had flooded the day before, I‚Äôm pretty sure most of the houses on the river were totally unoccupied, either because of flood damage or because they evacuated.  So theres a very good chance that there wasn‚Äôt anyone who saw it from their river home simply because no one was there.  Even though if they were, they‚Äôd have a front row view of it from any window in the house that faced the river on either side.  Also, my girlfriend works at a coffee shop in dow! ntown Wimberley so she kept an ear out for anyone talking about anything out of the ordinary, but never heard anything.  Neither did I hear anything from anyone about seeing anything. Lastly I wanted to describe the landscape of the area of the sighting a little more.  From where I took the pictures of the craft you can tell the altitude it was flying was very low.  If it were daytime you would be able to see that it was below and in front of the hills that crop up less than a mile or so across the river.  So there was no way it was something in the sky farther away simply because it would‚Äôve been completely obstructed by the hills. I hope this report is helpful and informative, as well as a good group of usable photos. Thank you for your service,  ((name deleted))",

     "text":"San Diego CA Marine Air Base Ball of Light I am a Marine veteran and I have decided to tell my story about a sighting that I experienced while working on security forces after the attack on 9/11.  My job in the Marines was TMO 3112. After the attacks on our nation I was detached from my unit and attached to PMO security forces.  I worked the graveyard shift from 1700-0600.  I was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, CA.   The evening of my sighting I was placed on duty, alone, to guard a gate on the flight-line.  I can‚Äôt remember the exact gate number, I believe it was 15, but I do know that it was at the north end where the c-130s were parked.  I had been on Security forces for awhile and I had a routine way of keeping myself alert and awake.  It is a severely punishable offence to fall asleep on post. I would take caffeine pills throughout the night and practice drill movements if I felt myself getting tired. On this particular evening I was very alert.  It was particularly cold that night, and being alone on post made me very aware of my surroundings.  The small shack that was my post was not heated, so I would frequently leave the shack and walk the small perimeter of the flight-line that was my post.   On the last of these walks I left my shack and began walking the flight-line.  Something above caught my eye.  As I reverted my gaze upward, I was astonished to see small, bright, circular, orb hovering about 200 yards above the flight-deck.  The object was no bigger than the circumference of my body. I am a female and I stand at about 65 inches.  In a flash, it shot down and hovered inches above the flight deck. It hovered there for a few moments, and then just as quickly as it came down, it shot back up into the night sky, and was gone. I was unsure of how to go about reporting it.  I logged the sighting in my log book and radioed it in to my command post.  I was almost immediately relieved of my duty at that post, by a Staff NCO.  I was told that I was tired and needed to go home and get some rest, and to report back for duty the following evening.  Now that I have fully performed my contract with the Marine Corps I feel that it is time to tell people other than close friends and family. I did not see little green men, or a flying saucer.  I saw what I believe was an unmanned recording device.  I have no reason to lie about what I saw and know that what I saw was real, and I hope that with this report maybe another Marine who was guarding another post on the flight-line that night will come forward.

     "text":"Daytime Sighting of Black Cone-Shaped Object Hovering in Sky On June 28, 2017, I was helping family members move into a new house.  At 2:37 pm, I was driving back to their old house to pick up the next load, when I noticed a stationary black object in the sky above the tree line in front of my car.  The jet black object caught my eye because it stuck out conspicuously against the crisp blue sky.  I immediately realized it was something out of the ordinary.  Excited and perplexed, I stopped the car and fumbled to get my phone out to capture it on video.  The object hovered silently and motionless in the sky.  It appeared to ascend slightly and very slowly at one point.  Otherwise, it did not move at all.  (A close review of the video suggests it also may have rotated along its vertical axis, like a spinning top, but I did not see any rotation while watching it with my own eyes).  It made no sound.  It was shaped like an upside-down cone or pyramid.  It had a distinct, sharp outline against the sky.  It looked dense, heavy and sturdy, and not made of flimsy or lightweight materials.  It definitely was not a natural object (e.g., a cloud or bird).  It looked mechanical, like some sort of machine.  But it did not have any discernable features of an aircraft (e.g., wings, propellers or a tail) or anything else that can fly.  It had no visible propulsion system or other means of flight.  It appeared shiny and shimmered somewhat, which I believe was sunlight reflecting off its surface.  Otherwise, it did not emit any light.  I asked a family member driving behind me if he saw the object (he did) and knew what it was (he did not).  He was not as interested in the object as I was and drove away.  After filming for about a minute, I also drove away because we were on a tight schedule.  I continued to watch the object as I drove and realized it was much higher up and farther away‚Äîand therefore much bigger‚Äîthan I initially thought.  I recorded three videos.  The first one at 2:37 p.m. is through my windshield and, unfortunately, does not keep the object in the frame very well.  I captured the second video through my open window at 2:38 p.m., a few hundred yards down the road.  I stopped again about a quarter mile farther down the road to record the third video at 2:39 p.m.  After that, I continued to look at the object while driving but lost sight of it around 2:42 p.m., when trees along the road obscured my view of the sky.  The last time I saw the object, it was still hovering in the same spot where I first noticed it.  I have speculated that the object could have been a balloon, a kite or a drone.  I ruled out the first two options mainly because it did not behave‚Äîe.g., sway, pitch or pivot‚Äîlike something that was tethered to the ground while flying.  Although a drone is the most plausible explanation, I do not think this was a drone.  The object was too high (~300-1000 ft.) and too large (~5-20 ft. tall) to be a drone, at least one available to the public.  It was also too motionless, for too long.  It did not drift or tilt in the wind; it simply did not move.  Even an experienced drone pilot probably cannot keep one completely still for several minutes in outdoor conditions.  I do not contend that the object I saw was (or was not) extraterrestrial.  I honestly do not know what it was or where it came from.  But I definitely saw something‚Äîa tangible object‚Äîin the sky that I cannot identify or explain.",

     "text":"Spacecraft entering Earth‚Äôs atmosphere     On September 15, 2012, at 9:35 PM, I witnessed an entry into Earth‚Äôs atmosphere of an unidentified spacecraft.  After having re-visited the site a couple of months after, I have revised my original account some. A friend and I were camping in the upper Big Hole Valley, 20 miles west of Jackson, Montana.  We were camped 1 mile upstream of Lower Minor Lake, 10 miles east of the Montana/Idaho border.  It is a remote area. Visibility was unlimited.  My account is: My friend had retired for the evening to his camper and it was probably a half hour after total darkness.  I had been checking out the stars with my binoculars, I lowered them and was looking toward the North Star.  An extremely bright yellow light, many times larger than the Space Station and a hundred times brighter, exploded in the sky.  Out of this coalesced an oval, silvery, luminescent spacecraft. And that is what it was, a spacecraft.  This craft dropped out of the sky at, I estimate, a steep 75 degree angle, heading south, almost right above me.  The craft decelerated quickly and getting larger and easier to see what it was.  The position of the ship was perpendicular to the earth‚Äôs surface when it entered our atmosphere, keeping in this position until it very smoothly, automatically it seemed, rotated to a ‚Äúright side up‚Äù position and leveled out, just as it disappeared in the darkness.  The spacecraft seemed like it was pulsating when it first appeared and it did go behind some sparse tall tree tops.  No external lights were visible and it was totally silent.  The craft continued flying south, paralleling just to the east of the Bitterroot Mountains and the Montana/Idaho border.  Speed by then was probably in the hundreds of miles per hour.  This seemed like it happened very fast, but it must have been 5-6 seconds or more. I had my best view when I was looking at the top portion of the spacecraft as it was rotating level.  Around its perimeter, it was plated, armored, fit together in a definite angled radius of the ship‚Äôs oval shape.  In the center was a raised half circle section, shaped in a radius in front and open in the rear, much like a game horse shoe. It was very sleek looking and was totally silent.  The spacecraft‚Äôs size; when I hold my arm out, the space between my thumb and finger would be about 1 to 1 ¬Ω.  I have short arms.  Thinking about it on where I was, the mountains surrounding me being some miles away, I think when it was at its closest, it was 2-3 miles and making the calculations, I believe it would be 100-200 feet long, 40-60 feet wide and thin, although I am not sure how thick it was.  When the craft entered the earth‚Äôs atmosphere or appeared, I feel it was 25,000‚Äô to 50,000‚Äô in elevation, probably higher than that. After this was over, I immediately went to the cab of my truck and wrote down the time and what happened. I then went over to my friend‚Äôs camper and asked him if he had seen anything and with it being totally silent, he hadn‚Äôt.  I then elaborated what I had just witnessed. On November 18th, I was able to stop back by, having to walk in this time of the year a mile in due to the snow to where we had camped and I saw the spacecraft.  It is one thing to have seen something and another to put it down on paper.  I wanted to go back to take some photos and get a better descriptive narrative in my own mind of what I saw.  The craft did come down higher than I originally thought, my original thought was 12,000‚Äô to 15,000‚Äô.  It is still my biggest unknown.  Those who have seen the Space Station flying thru the sky, gleaming brightly due to the sun‚Äôs reflection on it‚Äôs silvery surface, then only to disappear when the reflection is lost, will know what I mean.  Knowing this, this craft had to still be in the suns rays when it appeared and it was dropping rapidly and decelerating.  I also lowered the space between my finger and my thumb when I held my arm out to gauge its size, I originally had down 1 ¬Ω‚Äù to 2‚Äù and 200‚Äô to 400‚Äô long. Why did this alien craft choose this location to enter the earth‚Äôs atmosphere?  After reflecting on this for a bit, I think that with the upper Big Hole Valley, west of Jackson, Montana, being a very remote location, is why this area was chosen.   We were 10 miles east of the Montana/Idaho border.  Jackson residents would be able to see the initial explosion of re-entry, but only a silhouette after, if that, as they would be seeing the ‚Äúdark side‚Äù of the disc, as I was seeing the lit up side where I was.  The residents in the Salmon, Idaho area would be farther away and possibly see the explosion and briefly a ‚Äúfalling star‚Äù, until it disappeared behind the mountains.  I feel that is why the craft comes in perpendicular to the earth‚Äôs surface.  Its visibility is limited to the people to the east, where it is most in view.  Just before the craft rotated level, it lost the suns rays and disappeared.  I suppose the area should be checked to see if there were any reports of sighting! s or such that night.  There were a few more people camped out in the area, but not close to us.  Most people would be in their camps or trailers that time of the evening. It was an extraordinary event that I witnessed, especially the detail that I saw it in.  I do plan on having a drawing made up after I post this.",

Took a smooth route and was very fast, and would decrease speed.; Vanished I just witnessed an unidentified object approximately 1 hour ago.  I went out to get my car to get my ipod, and by chance witnessed the object out of the corner of my eye. The object was very bright orange, but not just solid orange, but kind of a firey contrast, I don't know how to explain it. It was similar the a thick cigar, but not as long, maybe half as long. This object had no noise! The object left no trail of smoke, and the object did NOT have any blinking lights whatsoever. I'm so shocked and kind of scared as I write this; I have never witnessed anything so horrifyingly real that i can recall. the object sped up a little bit, and then gradually decreased speed almost unnoticably if you didn't continually look at and study the object...it kept speeding up and gradually slowing down, and repeating this but not in a perfect sequence.  It was going straight somewhat and I anticipated it to go straight past my house but it shiftet direction and veered rig! ht not at a right angle but kind of circular. As i figured it would keep going, it STOPPED.  Almost right above my house but very high in the sky, higher than an airplane or helpicopter. lIKE a period on a piece of paper, id didn't move. It was bright and there was no flickering light or lights like on an airplane or helpicopter. It stayed stationary approximately 1 minute. I was frozen and shocked, and it VANISHED. God, it just disappeared. I made sure to look in that area and all around. There was no silohette or shadow or dark object. this thing disappeared quicker than a candle light being blown out. I called my friend to reveal what i had just seen, i am so dumbfounded and in shock. I was shaking as I told her. I just want to know if anybody has ever seen this, i'm lost for words. I know for fact this was a ufo spaceship of some sort. The night sky was very clear, THERE WERE NO OTHER AIR CRAFT IN THE AREA, there were no jet smoke streams in the air and the night was sil! ent, completely silent. I am at lost for words and am positive! that I saw some sort of alien spacecraft. Would like to hear of any similar sighting on thw 21!",

     "text":"Small maneuverable craft w/ two blue-white lights over Austin, TX At 11:15pm on the evening of January 25th, 2013, at least three people witnessed an unidentified object maneuvering at a very low altitude, estimated to vary between 50 and 150 feet, near the corner of Duval and 45th St. in Austin, Texas.  We observed from an estimated distance of about a city block away, perhaps less.  The sky was dark but overcast, no stars or moon were visible. No other aircraft were sighted during the occurrence.  The object was most definitely mechanical, and intelligently controlled. My impression of the object's size was that it was equivalent to or somewhat smaller than a helicopter, but I am uncertain.  The most significant physical feature was what appeared to be two blue-white lights in close proximity that seemed to quickly oscillate with yellow, looking like headlights. (Though they appeared as headlights, their apparent brightness remained relatively uniform despite three-dimensional maneuvering).  Somewhat higher and slightly offse! t from these was a smaller periodically flashing red light, but this was only intermittently visible, due I believe to the face of the object that contained the flashing light being turned away as it maneuvered.  Because of the lights' brightness and the dark of night, the actual shape of the object was difficult to make out.  The object made no sound, of jets or propeller blades, and left no contrails. The object's motion was most peculiar.  It was capable of great dexterity and unpredictability, sudden acceleration and stops, hovering, and a very slow controlled vertical descent.  It would shoot off very quickly in a straight line, stop on a dime, hover for about 30 seconds, then perform a very slow zigzag, stop and hover again for a period, then dip and weave off to another section of sky and repeat similar motions. At two points the object stopped in air, hovered, then very slowly descended vertically to disappear behind the roof edge of the apartment complex on the corner. It remained unseen from our vantage point for about 2 minutes, then unexpectedly came zipping back into view. For the entire period of observation, the object stayed within the same area, roughly a square city block. It did not appear to be following any conventional search pattern, but instead behaved very erratically.  I was waiting at the corner for a bus when I first noticed the object, noting it at first for the unusual brightness of the light and its low altitude. As I began to take photos with my phone (unfortunately, the camera is low-quality), a youth also waiting at the bus stop noticed and began to take video with his smart phone. As we continued to observe and document, marveling to each other and trying to identify the object, its motions became more and more bizarre, as described above. About 5 minutes into this, a resident of the apartment complex came by, noticed and commented on the strangeness of the object as well, but didn't stay for more than a moment. After about 15 minutes, the battery on my phone had gone out, and the object had disappeared beyond the roof's horizon for several minutes. As I traded contact info with the youth, the bus came; I got on and left. I can confirm without reservation that the object I saw was neither a plane nor a helicopter of any type. I did observe a police helicopter performing a search later in the evening in a different part of town, and can report that the light patterns and motions of the two were absolutely dissimilar. I am a 29-year-old college graduate, history major. I work in education, helping to build websites for educational curriculum. I am not an active UFO hunter, and have never seen anything like this before. I don't know the fellow taking the video or his background, but he appeared to be about 18, and was just as flabbergasted as I was. The woman who observed in passing was most likely a college student, as that area is very close to the University of Texas. I am still waiting for word from the youth, hoping that he will send me the video to forward along. Unfortunately, the photos I did manage to get on my phone are pretty low-resolution, but if you zoom in on the bright blue object in the center of most of them, you will see the basic shape of the twin lights I have described.",

Last Friday night, 5/18/12, from about 10:00PM on we were out in the hot tub watching the northern sky as we do regularly.  Around 10:15 - 10:30 we saw a rather spectacular sight.  An object traveled across the entire sky from southeast to northwest at an elevation of about 30 degrees above the horizon as it passed in front of us.  We saw no maneuvering, but it might have turned slightly more north toward the end of our viewing.  It was orange in color and looked like a burning orange, but no flames.  It was not a spec but rather a sphere or disc, perhaps subtending an angle ¬º that of a full moon.  No changes in appearance, color or speed.  Its altitude appeared to be that of small private aircraft.  It could not have been as high as commercial jets because had it been, its speed would have been so great that we would have experienced a sonic boom.  It was moving moderately quickly, I estimate at 200 mph.  What was most interesting is that there was no sound! from it!  We both are adults, an engineer and a teacher.  We‚Äôve seen many things in the night sky:  aircraft, spacecraft (ISS, Iridium Flares, etc).  Never anything like this.",

     "text":"Saw a fireball up close with my wife and 4 year old son. On August 22rd, 2013 I was in my basement when my four year old son came down to inform me there was a star outside. I thought it odd, and went upstairs to check it out. When I came upstairs, my wife was at the window telling me to look outside and that there might be a ufo outside. I grabbed my Nikon p500 camera and went outside to look, and there was in fact something on the horizon, possibly 1000ft in the air, and a few thousand yards away. I turned my camera on, zoomed in with a 36x zoom, and my camera was set on auto mode and the long exposure setting kicked in.  The picture turned out horrible.  I attempted to take another photo and while I was looking at it in the viewfinder, it disappeared before my eyes. I went inside, and my family was on edge. I said some words to my family and then called some people to tell them what I saw.  I was on the phone with a friend from work when I heard my wife tell me, \"... you have to come here and see this.\" I went outside and looked on the horizon where I saw the ufo before and couldn't see anything.  My wife told me to look to my left and I did. My heart sank, my adrenaline kicked in and I became scared.  A stones throw away, about 20ft off the ground was a floating ball of fire flying between me and the street light, following the path of the street.  I could see every single detail on this thing and it looked like this.  In the center was a perfect circle maybe the size of a half dollar coin and this circle was bright orange. Radiating from the center circle was a larger spherical aura that almost looked like the mist you see when looking directly at an atomizer spray bottle (like on a Windex bottle set to mist) except that it was fire.  Around this larger sphere were flames that went upwards, just like if you were looking at a camp fire.  The flames were fire red/orange and it moved through the air very very slowly, about 1-3mph.  The total size of it was about the size of a basketball, perhaps slightly larger.  It was 100% silent. As this thing moved the fire trailed behind it.  I prayed to Jesus Christ to protect us and this thing did a 90 degree turn, and left.  It slowly ascended, southbound, over perhaps a 2000 meter distance, climbing to maybe 500-1000ft, then it disappeared.  I tried to take photos of this object when it was up close, but I was shaking very badly.  My photos look like trash, but they are the real deal.  I still have the originals on my camera if needed.  I also took a video, and unfortunately it too is shaky, but it's there for what it's worth.  These things are real, but I'm telling you the truth: they are not what the world thinks they are. Having seen this thing up close, I can tell you they are very real, alive and subject to Jesus Christ. They appear and disappear at will, and It is likely that they are demonic and deliberately deceiving the world.  Don't fall for it. If you read this, you were warned and without excuse.  Repent, confess the Lord Jesus Christ with your mouth and believe in your heart that God raised him from the grave and you will be saved. It's true, I witnessed this thing first hand flee at the hand of the living God.",

     "text":"2 Spherical Crafts, one Engulfed in Purple, the other a Blueish Green Good afternoon, I have been fully engaged in the search UFO's since my first encounter when I was 11 years old.  living in Mound, MN.  That night at around 11:00pm, I saw a very large bright light escaping from the second to last star on the handle of the \"big dipper\", it was heading due east for about 5 seconds before it shot straight up and out of sight in a blink of an eye.  My second sighting came in late March of 2000 at about 5:30pm on my way home from work driving West from Mound to Watertown.  I was looking straight ahead at a large cloud off in the distance when a silver UFO came peeking out of the clouds, it stopped about 20 feet out in the open when another one popped out and went right over it.  The two crafts literally played leap-frog in and out of the clouds for about 2 minutes then disappeared.   The reason I am emailing you is not because of those two sightings, but of my last one which was also seen by my fianc√© and eldest son.  This time, there were two UFOS and we got one of them on video and the other one on camera.  This occurred on September 18th, 2014 at around 9:00pm just over our house in Waconia, MN.  The craft was hovering above our house for about 5 minutes then headed SE at an incredible speed and evenutaully out of sight.  The craft had lights but the entire thing was engulfed in a deep purple haze.  It looked like a purple ball surrounding the UFO. We captured this craft on video with my sons phone.  You can't see the color but you get to see it fly away, make a couple 90 degree turns, stop on a dime, go straight up and back down.  It made ZERO sound and was nothing I have ever seen on ANY alien show before.  I have seen hundreds of UFO Sighting shows, Hangar 1, etc....and what I saw has never been documented as far as I can remember. My son and I chased it for 15 minutes in our car but saw nothing so we headed back home.  Before I could pull into our driveay my son yelled to stop the ca! r.  We got out and sure enough the second UFO was right above ! out hous e in the same spot as the other one.  It too headed in the exact same direction.  This one was a blueish green color changing between the two. We got a picture of this craft. It also made no sound.  There was also a very large, low-flying, incredibly slow-moving(what looked to be a very, very large military plane) that my son and I both saw over the city of Waconia within 30 minutes of the original sighting. I have wanted to be a part of MUFON for the last 5 years or so.  I would love nothing more than to be an investigator. I want to help people with their stories and most importantly, I want to bring UFO's out in the open for everyone to see.  They are real, they are here and they aren't going away.  I would love to show MUFON my video and picture. I am not afraid nor do i care of what people think or say.  I honestly believe that this is what I was meant to be doing with my life.  I look forward to hearing back from you.",

     "text":"Life altering UFO abduction experiences  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I‚Äôm a 47 year old male who‚Äôs had a multitude of UFO experiences throughout many years which begins as follows:  1974,  one spring morning I was a 13 year old kid living on a farm with my parents on Roblar Rd. Petaluma California. My older brother and I were headed for the school bus just up the road while on our walk we spotted two small red brightly glowing spheres around the size of small basket balls. The red balls came out of some bushes across the road then danced around each other as they hovered in front of my brother and my faces. Both of us were stunned and starred as these hovering balls of light moved around us then proceeded up the middle of the road as they sped off. When the reached the top of the hill they headed straight up then disappeared.  My brother and I just looked at each other without saying a word. My brother shrugged his shoulders and shook it off as if he‚Äôd just seen something that didn‚Äôt exist. The other kids showed up at the bus stop and I asked if any of them saw the lights when one of the kids said, ‚ÄúThey were car lights you saw you moron.‚Äù I dismissed the incident and really didn‚Äôt think any more about it till later in life.  One summer night in 1977 my older brother, two girls and myself were in the Sonoma Mountains in Sonoma County California drinking a few beers like a lot of teens did at the time when my first incident occurred.  It was late night, around midnight, my brother and I were standing outside the vehicle while the two girls were inside when my brother pointed to some bushes around a football field away and said, ‚ÄúWhat the f---- is that?‚Äù I looked to where he was pointing and I saw a rather large glowing orange dome just on the other side of the trees. Not knowing what it was I replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I became entranced with the object as it began growing in size getting bigger and bigger. My brother ordered me back in the car and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of here.‚Äù  I said, ‚ÄúNo, wait, let‚Äôs check it out.‚Äù He once again ordered, ‚ÄúGet the f---- in the car little brother or I‚Äôm leaving you here.‚Äù I jumped in, we took off down the mountains and nothing more was said about it until a few days later when my brother asked, ‚ÄúDo you know what that was we saw in the mountains?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a clue.‚Äù My brother continued and said, ‚ÄúLittle brother, that was God!‚Äù  Thinking he was kind of nuts for saying it I dismissed the conversation. This concluded this incident.  Later on that same year, sometime in the winter evening, I was once again parked close to the same spot in the mountains with a different friend this time. It was around 10:00 pm. And we were talking about things we wondered about. I was saying I wonder why this and this happens when my friend said, ‚ÄúWhat I wonder is what the hell is that?‚Äù He was pointing to an orange harvest moon across town just above the other mountain range. I laughed and replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the moon you idiot.‚Äù My friend looked dead serious to me then pointed up into the sky then said, ‚ÄúOh yeah, then what‚Äôs that.‚Äù He was now pointing at what appeared to be another moon. Being rather shocked I replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  We watched as another harvest moon appeared next to the first one in the mountains, soon a third one appeared.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to check these things out,‚Äú Said my friend as he started the car and sped across town to the other set of mountains. We weren‚Äôt sure exactly where they were so we guessed and headed out Two Rock Road in Petaluma California. When we reached the coast guard base we drove up to the guard tower and asked if they saw three glowing harvest moons in the mountains. Needless to say they treated us as if we were nuts and sent us on our way. That night we never did find the objects or see them anywhere else.  1984, Seven years later, I was around 24  years old working in Healdsburg California. I had to commute from Petaluma California to Healdsburg which was around a 45 minute drive everyday which I had to be at work by 6:00 AM. Needless to say I had to get up pretty early in the morning to make it there. I‚Äôve always been a very anal person always making it to work at least 20 minutes early so I could have enough time to relax, drink some coffee and back in those days, smoke some cigarettes. This incident is a weird one as I didn‚Äôt remember most of what I‚Äôm writing about until much later in life. Anyway, I left to work one day at the same time that I always left then headed up Highway 101 north to Healdsburg. I remember leaving the town of Santa Rosa Heading North and driving through what used to be the usual desolate area of Windsor. As I was driving suddenly I started feeling very tired when I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed two very bright lights, speeding up on me. I thought to myself who‚Äôs this idiot going this fast? As the lights approached the rear of my vehicle my car slowed down to a stop. I remember trying to give it gas but it wouldn‚Äôt move. Suddenly the car went completely dead and all I could see were very bright lights behind me. I remember wondering what was going on. The lights moved from the rear of my vehicle rising above my car, when suddenly I hear a loud bumping noise much like a tow truck would make as it lifts up a car. I felt my car being lifted off the ground. I tried opening the doors but they were locked. I remember jumping into the back seat and trying the rear door but it was locked. I remember white light all around me and being totally petrified. The next thing I remember was sitting in the driver seat with my engine running but parked off on the side of the road. I shook my head in disbelief and wondered what happened if anything.  I stepped on the gas an my car took off up highway 101 as I headed to Healdsburg. I seriously didn‚Äôt know what happened and wondered if an! ything d id happen at all. I arrived to work, went in and poured a cup of coffee like I usually did. I lit up a smoke when and noticed one of my co-workers working. I asked, ‚ÄúHey D--, why are you here so early?‚Äù D-- looked at me, laughed and replied, ‚ÄúWhy are you so late?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúLate, what do you mean? I‚Äôm not late.‚Äù He laughed again and said, ‚ÄúYou idiot, you‚Äôre 20 minutes late.‚Äù Being a little bewildered I put out my smoke then headed to the time clock where I realized he was right, I wasn‚Äôt only 20 minutes late but, rather 40 as I usually arrived 20 minutes early every day. When I got home both my wife and I checked our clocks and none of them were off. There were 40 minutes missing from my day.  1987 Three years later I was around 27 years old living in a cottage on a hill in rural Petaluma California. It was sometime in spring around 2:00 am. I woke to the sound of a humming noise and looked at the walls above my bed noticing bright lights going around them. I tried to wake up my wife but couldn‚Äôt so I hopped out of bed. I went to my daughters room next to ours and checked in on her and she was sound asleep also. I walked in the living room which had windows overlooking the hillside. I looked out the window past the grove of trees and saw bright lights. There was nothing on the hill and the lights made no sense at all being there. The lights resembled the brightness of lights used by freeway crews while working on the roads at night.  I turned and noticed the lights bouncing off the wall mirrors so wanting to get a better look a headed out the front door, closing it behind then out off the porch into the yard. In my underwear I exited the gate which opened in to the field then looked up on the hill. About 200‚Äô in front of me was a large glowing sphere hovering a few feet off the ground. The sphere resembled a small harvest moon and I remembered wondering if I made a mistake going out to investigate. I looked back at the house and seeing the front door closed I wanted to go back in. I couldn‚Äôt move as I seemed to be paralyzed. Being very frightened I looked back at the sphere when suddenly three images appeared standing in the field. The images were men which looked just like us except very tall. They were somewhere around 8‚Äô tall, well built and had bald heads. They were dressed in black jumpsuits and wore side arms. The next thing I remember was waking up in my bed around 8:00 am on a Saturday Morning. I remember opening my eyes wondering if I dreamed the who thing. It almost seemed like hours were missing from my night and I had a small hole or mark right in the center of my forehead which wasn‚Äôt there before.  Years later the entire incident started coming back to me and I began remembering  what happened. It was around 2000 when it became very vivid. There were not only the three beings looking like us but also others resembling the typical aliens with big eyes and grey skin. The beings looking like us seemed to be in charge and the other‚Äôs worked with them. The mark in my forehead, which is still there today was made by a long needle type instrument which was inserted into my skull. This instrument was used for something I‚Äôm not sure of. They communicated with me telepathically and seemed to download and upload information into and out of me. In summary, the visit was a religious experience in which they told me God and Jesus are real and do exist. I wasn‚Äôt a religious man before these incidents but afterwards they changed my life. What we communicated about back and forth was very in-depth and there‚Äôs not enough paper or time to cove the topics but, I‚Äôll reiterate in saying they convinced me Jesus is still alive and went on to say that they are us and we are them. We come from them as they are our past.",

     "text":"Saw a green UFO really close to my car, lowered in valley; resulted in panicked coyote hit on I-91. I was driving on Interstate 91 in Massachusetts, just before the Vermont border.  I was in Bernardston. It was just before 1 am and I was driving in my car I had just gotten last month.  As I was driving, my light behind my radio display caught my eye because it went really dark and kept flickering between off and barely on.  The lights on my dash were acting funny too, as were my headlights. This snapped me out of my highway daze, as I had been driving for an hour and ‚Äúin the zone.‚Äù  Mind you, this is a new car‚Äîthis obviously isn‚Äôt normal behavior. When I began paying attention again from this I caught sight of a green light to my right in a sort of valley. I was in the traveling lane towards the guardrail, and the land appeared to dip there.  What I saw shocked me‚Äîit was what I can best describe as a floating piece of abstract art. Next to my car, it was massive, but in terms of Hollywood UFO sightings, it was very small. Nothing large to make those sorts of cropcircles you see in the news, either‚Äîvery small next to those, but big next to my car. It was about five to ten feet higher in the air than my car‚Äôs roof was and was extremely close to me and low to the ground, again, in the valley. There was a guy driving in front of me and he was the only other driver around, and he braked and flashed his hazards so I know he saw it, too. Up close, it looked like it had a sea foam green sort of paint job on the belly, with precise lines and evenly marked. It was probably a three-foot-high green under border wrapping up the pieces jutting out from it. The rest was a dark chrome/silver. It had between four and six green lights that were darker on the outside of the circular shine, and a lighter shade in the middle. It had weird rectangles sort of prodding out, and odd tentacle shaped pieces. Think of the Grinch‚Äôs mountain, and flip it sideways curling up, and more of a gradual slimming of shape. This too had the border and there was a green light on top of it. this was the section I focused most on. The rest of the craft blurs in my mind; I focused on this and remember thinking it looked like a mish-mosh of shapes that somehow flowed smoothly together. I stared at it in absolute shock for a few seconds‚Äîand then the lights pulsed. The lights were not in a perfect line‚Äîsome were up, some were down, some in the middle of the craft. The lights pulsed brighter, dimmer, brighter, dimmer, and then suddenly the craft was far away. It went north. It paused in the distance, and then vanished in a second. At this point, I‚Äôm honestly freaking out, wondering what I just saw. Again, I am in the travelling lane, and the thing I just saw was on my right over the valley. The valley ends and I‚Äôm driving, not a full 30 seconds have even passed, and a coyote comes flying out of the grass on my right side. I‚Äôve never seen a coyote, or any animal ever run that fast before‚Äîit was white, with a yellow tint to it. Think of a white lab‚Äîthat color.  I had absolutely no warning and it appeared just a few feet in front of my car, racing, not being chased and not chasing anything, no other coyotes around (and don‚Äôt they run in packs generally?) and I had absolutely no time or room to react. I was forced into hitting it, going 65 as I was on the highway. Again, I have a new car‚Äîit‚Äôs a sturdy car. It hit so hard that my front quarter panel went flying off. I called the cops right away fearing for the poor coyote maybe still in the road and to report the incident. The cops showed up and couldn‚Äôt find this coyote I hit going 65 anywhere. Whatever scared it scared it so bad it couldn‚Äôt stop running. I hit hard. My quarter panel was way across the other side of the highway.  In order to tell the cops my location,  this all took place around the 48th and 49th mile marker on Interstate 91. The valley is within the 48th, going northbound, and I hit the coyote just before a merging area on the 49th. I can‚Äôt help but feel these two cases are related. I told the cops about what I had seen and they totally dismissed me and even started talking to each other over me, acting like I was a crazy person. I had just hit an animal, it was 1 am just about, and I was shaking harder than I ever shook on my life‚Äîthey probably assumed I was on drugs. Whatever the case, they totally dismissed me and I‚Äôm not too excited about that‚Äîpeople tend to not take you very seriously about paranormal happenings. Now, I‚Äôm extremely anxious being outside at night, especially when it‚Äôs clear out. This event scared me terribly‚ÄîI‚Äôm far more upset over the UFO than the coyote, though I feel really bad for the coyote. Looking back, I also wish I had the radio on. I had a CD playing and turned it down when I noticed something amiss. I wonder if that would have been affected.",

     "text":"Bright Zig-Zagging Light over Des Moines, 6/24/10 So, I'm standing on my back Deck in the town of Waukee, Iowa [6/24/2010, APRX 9:15 OR 10:15 PM CST] waiting for my dog to pee so I could take her back in and go to bed. Explanation of the time discrepancy: I vaguely remember looking at a clock after this sighting and THOUGHT it said 9:15, but realized the next day that the sun hadn‚Äôt fully set by 9:15 on that day and I remember it being dark, because despite the ambient light of the city to the east of my house, I could clearly see stars. This leads me to believe that it was really 10:15 and I had misread the clock the night before. Anyway, on 6/24/2010, as I look up, I glance to the west south west I see a very bright white light moving in a easterly direction (toward me, toward Des Moines proper). The brightness is what caught my eye. It was traveling (as near as I can figure) in a straight line toward the east, perhaps east, north east. No green/red aircraft lights as one would see on an airliner. In fact I saw a jet liner flying to the east far above this object. I am not good at estimating altitude but it, and as such I have a hard time telling you how big this thing was. But the jet liner moving east above this thing looked to be more than twice as high, that's the impression I got anyway. So I figured, it's an airplane with its landing lights on and the landing lights are washing out the red/green strobes so that I can't see them. But as the thing keeps moving east, the light doesn't die out at all. If it were an aircraft landing light, it would be directional. You might see it very brightly as the aircraft was moving toward you but it would become more difficult to see as the plane moved over and started moving away from you. The thing moved over where I was standing, perhaps to the south of my position a little bit but clearly over the city of Des Moines, then it kept moving at the same rate of speed BUT it began moving (or at least the light did) in a slightly, nearly unnoticeable zig-zag manner. Mind you, I can see nothing but the bright white light. I see no craft/structure, no wings, nothing but the light. And the light continues off in an easterly direction until I lose sight of it behind the roofline of the other houses behind mine. It moved in a straight tack and for about 15 seconds, in a slightly zig-zag manner but it stayed at a steady speed. It wasn't very fast at all. The jet liner above it overtook it easily. It made no noise that I could hear but it might have been too far away and it appeared to be illuminated all the way around. In other words, the light stayed bright, no matter the angle at which I viewed the thing. I doubt it was a helicopter because if it was it seemed too high (although I have a hard time judging altitude) and even if it was a helicopter, what's with the 360 degree illumination effect? Even those super bright spotlights on helicopters are directional. I tried taking a picture of it, but my crappy cell phone camera is all I had close and all you could see was a blurry white spot on a black background, it didn't tell the story at all and I deleted it out of frustration (sorry). By the time I could have gone in and gotten my good camera, come out, set it up and get the shot, the thing would have been gone. So, whatever this thing was, I remember thinking that the airliner flying above might not have been able to see it because of the illumination from the city below, but who knows? If the airliner did see it, he didn't alter his course or anything so it must not have concerned him. But the thing was very bright, in comparison to the stars (and the night was very clear), it was easily noticeable at first glance. All told, it crossed the sky (from rooftops to the west to roofline in the east) in about 90-120 seconds. I remember distinctly thinking that whatever I was seeing wasn't normal so I made a point to watch it intently (another reason I didn't go for the good camera). It was right after I made this decision that it started to zig-zag (again, ever-so slightly) and I remember wondering just what exactly I was seeing. The zig-zag was just enough to be noticeable but slight enough to make me wonder if I was perhaps seeing things correctly. Now I am rationalizing and explaining it away as any number of plausible explanations. But the fact that it was #1 so bright #2 had no red/greens #3 moving relatively slowly compared with the air traffic above it #4 IT ZIG ZAGGED. I'm baffled and my logic tells me that it could not have zig-zagged, but I KNOW I saw the thing zig-zag!  So tell me I'm not crazy! Explain this thing to me. I know what it was not...It wasn't a balloon (too fast, steady speed, night, over a metro area close to an airport). I know it wasn't the space station, a meteor or a satellite...a jet liner flew OVER it. The jet-liner above it was further to the south than the light, but from my angle I watched as the airplane disappeared briefly behind this light then reappeared as the plane outpaced the light. I seriously doubt that it was a helicopter. I was a flight medic for some years and I know rotor-craft, especially the commonly seen rotor-craft in this area. The flight path didn't make sense (for a medical helicopter anyway). It came from out of town and bypassed all hospitals and went back out of town to the east. Maybe it was military, but our Air Guard base is south of where this thing flew...it wasn't on approach to DSM International, it was WAY too far north, its course did not change and it didn‚Äôt appear to change altitude at all (again difficult to judge & be certain). It certainly didn't just take off from DSM either.  I suppose it could have been like a private plane/jet or even a military jet, but I could hear NOTHING and what's with the light?  Let alone the ZIG ZAGGING!!!???  Once the light disappeared over the roofline to the east and I could no longer see it, I brought the dog back in and went to bed.  I had completely forgotten about seeing the light until the following evening and I shared this report on an online forum where someone suggested that I report the event to you.",

I use the vehicle headlights to illuminate the front door while locking the office on particular dark nights.  Looking immediately west I noticed what appeared to be the landing lights of an aircraft approaching the Eau Claire airport.  Note, the office is right under a normal flight path for Northwest Airline flights coming from the Twin Cities and it is very common to see the landing lights used on their approaches to Eau Claire.  In any case I attributed the exceptionally bright light to that of an aircraft on approach.  The light was due west at an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 feet in altitude and coming slowly east on a trajectory that would have put it right over the office on River Road in less than a minute.  I watched it for a few seconds and did not see anything out of the ordinary but I did notice there was no sound coming from the area of the light.  With approaching aircraft it is normal to hear them a minute before one is able to make a visual.  But it was late, I was tired, and I thought nothing more of it until I started my drive home it seemed to alter its course rapidly.  Leaving east out of the driveway the object essentially stopped for a brief second or two and changed course to north-northwest course and began lowering in altitude.  I turned north on a cut-off road to Highway 170 and watched as the craft moved slowly northwest and dropped in altitude on slightly as it was still much higher than the surrounding hills.  I turned west on Hwy 170 and watched the craft moving in the direction towards the Wheeler radio tower.  Total drive of about 2 miles and a time of about 4 minutes.  As I turned into my house driveway I lost site of the object behind a row of tall pine trees and a hill.  I entered my house, scrambled for a few minutes tying to find a pair of binoculars ‚Äì to no avail.  So I got my girlfriend to come with out in the field to see if we could locate the object.  As we rounded the blocking hill we easily made visual contact with the craft again.  At this time the light was farther away but still very bright and more red flickering taking place.  The location appeared to be slightly sou! th of th e radio tower and about 1,000 to 2,000 feet higher than the top of the tower (the tower is about 1,000 ft.).  I must qualify that the craft appeared to be near the tower, it could have been farther west of the tower but it more likely was nearby.  As we watched for several minutes it appeared as if it was not moving.  Then it decided to start slowly lowering sometimes straight down and sometimes with erratic zigzag patterns.  Eventually it was at the same height reference of the Wheeler tower and stayed there for a few minutes.  Then it started to lower again and this time it moved slightly more north in what appeared to be very close proximity to the tower itself. Eventually it dropped to a point where we could only see it at random through trees and hills.  In the last few minutes of visual it seemed as though the object was on the ground moving around between trees.  The motions as it was on, or near, the ground were slightly erratic and we had to shift positions frequently to keep it in sight.  Finally about midnight or slightly after we lost all visual sight. Her and I watched the light for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Short of the time I lost sight in my driveway and was looking for the binoculars I was able to watch the craft for about 25 to 30 minutes total time.  Shortly after midnight we  took a drive to the radio tower location.  There were several households with lights on in the immediate vicinity of the radio tower.  We do not know if these people were awake, or saw something, or whatever but we did not stop to ask for fear of being ridiculed.  Neither my girlfriend nor myself can explain what it was but we do know for an absolute fact we watched something very strange.",

ABOVE THE HORIZON.   I RAN AND GOT MY PHONE TO CALL SOME PEOPLE BUT DECIDED TO TRY TO GET VIDEO OF IT WITH THE PHONE, KNOWING THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PICK UP ANYTHING USABLE.   AFTER A FEW SECONDS ANOTHER RED LIGHT CAME INTO VEIW FOLLOWING THE FIRST FLYING AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER ALTITUDE AT A DISTANCE OF TWO FINGERS TOGETHER AT AN ARMS LENGTH BEHIND THE OTHER ONE.  BY THIS TIME I HAD GOT TO THE VERY TOP OF AN EIGHT FOOT LADDER THAT WAS ALREADY SET UP IN THE YARD SO I COULD GET UP ON THE ROOF AND WATCH THESE THINGS AS LONG AND FAR AS POSSABLE.  A THIRD OBJECT CAME INTO VEIW SAME ALTITUDE AND DISTANCE AS THE PREVIOUS AND THEN ANOTHER MAKING FOUR! RED LIGHTS FLYING IN A LINE ONE BEHIND THE OTHER.  HERE I WAS ON THE ROOF OF MY HOUSE DRESSED IN NOTHING BUT BOXERS AND ALL ALONE WATCHING THESE GUYS TRAVEL BY AND NOBODY AROUND TO YELL TO SOO THEY CAN SEE ALSO.  WITH THE LIGHTS ALMOST OUT OF VEIW ON THE EASTERN HORIZON I WAS GETTING READY TO GET OFF THE ROOF THEN ANOTHER TWO LIGHTS CAME INTO VEIW FLYING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE PREVIOUS BUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE CLOSER AND A LITTLE BRIGHTER.  THE FITH LIGHT WAS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE REST AND THE SIXTH SLIGHTLY LOWER BUT STILL HIGHER THAN THE PREVIOUS FOUR.  I AM A 37 YEAR OLD EXPERIENCED ASTRONOMER USING A LARGE TELESCOPE FOR MANY YEARS, I KNOW WHAT SATELLITES LOOK LIKE AND HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF KNOWLEDGE OF AIRCRAFT AND THEIR FLIGHT PATHS AND SUCH.   I AM SURE THAT WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT WERE NOT DRONES,CHINESE LANTERNS, WEATHER BALLOONS, SWAMP GAS OR ANY NORMAL AIRCRAFT DUE TO THE LACK OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND MARKERS REQUIRED ON ALL AIRCRAFT NOR WERE THERE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT AROUND IN THE SKY.   AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO AFTER THE SIXTH LIGHT PAST BY, I DECIDED TO GET OFF THE ROOF AND JUMP IN MY CAR.  I TOOK NOTE OF THE TIME 9:05PM PACIFIC AND AS FAST AS I COULD I GRABBED SOME PANTS,NIGHT VISION,CAMERA AND SOME BINOCULARS WHICH WERE ALL TOGETHER ON THE DINING TABLE.  I HAD ALL OF THESE THINGS READY TO GO BECAUSE I HAVE OBSERVERD THESE RED LIGHTS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE WEEKS PRIOR WHICH WERE REPORTED TO THIS WEB SITE.  WHILE I WAS GETTING DRESSED A LOW FLYING HELICOPTER FLEW OVER MY HOUSE FROM THE SOUTH TOWARDS THE NORTH THAT HAD ONLY A FLASHING RED LIGHT ON THE BOTTOM OF IT BUT THIS WAS LIKELY THE NORMAL MEDIVAC HELICOPTER. I HAVE HAD AN IN MY FACE CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN 2001 OF A LOW FLYING TRIANGLE THAT I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH AND WISH NEVER HAPPEND AND SINCE THEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I SAW WITH COUNTLESS HOURS OF READING AND LISTENING TO ANYTHING THAT MAY BE LINKED TO THE SUBJECT IN A QUEST TO GET SOME SORT OF ANSWER TO WHAT I OBSERVED. LAST WEEK I CALLED AM1080 KSCO, A LOCAL AM RADIO STATION AND ASKED THEM TO ! ASK PEOPLE IN THE AREA IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY. I HAVE ASKED POLICE OFFICERS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE SOME KIND OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHAT IS FLYN AROUND ABOVE US. I TAKE THIS KIND OF STUFF SERIOUSLY AND WOULD SAY THAT I AM NOT OVERLY SERIOUS ABOUT IT BUT SOME MAY THINK OTHERWISE. ANYWAYS HERE I AM HAULN BUTT DOWN THE ROAD IN MY CAR WITH MY EQUIPTMENT IN HAND IN AN EFFORT TO CATCH UP WITH THESE LIGHTS AND REALIZE THAT I DONT HAVE A CHANCE IN HELL OF CATCHING UP WITH THESE THINGS AND DECIDE TO STOP AT THE NEIGHBORS HOUSE AROUND THE BLOCK. I PULL INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND BEFORE I EVEN TURN OFF THE CAR FOUR KIDS RANGING IN AGE FROM 4 TO 12 COME RUNNING UP TO ME ASKING IF I SAW THE RED LIGHTS IN THE SKY. I TOLD THE KIDS HOLD ON A MINUTE AND TOOK OFF BACK TO MY HOUSE TO GET MY DIGITAL RECORDER. I AM FAMILIAR WITH INTERVEIWING PEOPLE AND KNOW THAT QUESTIONING PEOPLE ESPECIALLY KIDS ALWAYS GOES BETTER IF THEY DONT KNOW T! HEY ARE BEING RECORDED, IT MAY NOT BE TOTALY LEAGAL BUT I FIGU! RE ITS T HE BEST WAY TO DOCUMENT WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO TELL ME. TURNS OUT THEY HAD BEEN WATCHING A FEW RED LIGHTS IN THE WESTERN SKY SINCE ABOUT 8:00PM AND HAD CALLED ME TO TELL ME BUT I DID NOT HAVE MY PHONE ON ME BECAUSE I WAS OUTSIDE IN MY BOXERS WATERING MY LAWN. THE KIDS EVEN DRUG OUT A TELESCOPE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET TO WATCH THE LIGHTS AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WATCHED A RED LIGHT IN THE WEST STAY STATIONARY FOR OVER A HALF OF AN HOUR THEN WATCHED IT GAIN A LITTLE ALTITUDE AND THEN TAKE OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THEY ALSO SAID THAT THE OBJECTS WOULD DISAPPEAR AND THEN REAPPEAR IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION I RECORDED THESES FOUR KIDS SEPERATLY AND GOT SOME EXELENT STUFF.   SO THERE YOU HAVE IT GUYS FOR THE THIRD WEEK IN A ROW RED LIGHTS IN THE NIGHT SKY.  DONT BE AFRAID TO TELL SOMEBODY BECAUSE ODDS ARE THEY HAVE WITNESSED SOMETHING ALSO.

     "text":"Red Light Above Boise Descends at Tremendous Speed, Stops to Hover, Emits Radiation - All filmed by Observer 01/16/2010   Brief Summary:  At approximately 1915 hours MST,  I was watching one of my security cameras and noticed an odd flash of red light illuminating my yard.  This peaked my interest and I went outside to check, but saw nothing. I returned inside and a few minutes later, the infrared cameras picked it up again.  I then inspected the perimeter of the building and searched up and down the adjacent streets; it was then that I noticed a bright red object to the NorthWest of my location.  It was above the cloud deck and was not a planet. Note that Mars was on the Solar Planar and visible to the East and other planets were obscured by cloud coverage.  I hopped in my truck and felt compelled to investigate this object.  As I headed around my block and onto Hill Rd.  I continued to keep an eye on the object, which was descending and/or getting brighter.  Having seen MANY objects similar to this one over the past 9 months, I was very calm and prepared for almost anything.   But this was different.  I traveled no further than 8 blocks and traveled up a dead end street to the north.  All lights in the neighborhood dimmed, my truck lost power, and I was mesmerized as this Red Light became a shape. It descended even closer to me and literally came to within 100 Meters from my vehicle.  I pulled out my cell phone and began filming it.  The video details far more than what I saw... I saw a Red Craft maneuver from at least 15K feet altitude to 100 meters in front of me in 3-5 seconds!  I found myself face to face with something that looked like it had retro-rockets on it, and then an EXTREMELY bright light that it shined into my face, causing nausea, mild confusion and a severe headache.  I've seen at least 100 unexplained objects in my life, but based upon my background, training and desire to not jump to conclusions, I've never reported one before.  This one is different.  It sent a message.  I feel ill right now and have what appear to be radiation burns on my fingers and symptoms of radiation sickness. The video when viewed  frame by frame, along with my narration, details a few seconds when the craft seemed to generate a \"plasma-like Orb\" and then swirled it around and shot a beam at me. Close analysis by my Dad and I found at the same moment, the glass of my vehicle warped, and I stopped talking, lost my bearing and then regained focus again. It wasn't so much that the object seemed malevolent, but rather that it was aware of my presence and allowing me to film it, yet at the same time, it felt like it was telling me to leave. OBSERVER BACKGROUND: Observer is a 41 year old College Educated Computer Engineer with 16 years experience, as well as P.O.S.T.

The \"Star\" was larger than the average star on this early morning, it had a reddish orange hue, and flickered every so slightly.  I assumed that it was Mars, just peeking out over the rooftops. I downloaded the Skymaps app last week, so I open the app expecting the object to be Mars. However, nothing celestial was in that vicinity, especially not something that bright. My second logical assumption was that it was an aircraft, or perhaps a satellite; however unusual, since the light was as bright as Mars typically is. I watched the object and was able to realize that it was in fact moving. However, it was behaving erratically. Up up up, to the right, wobble, up up up, to the right, wobble; ever so slightly. Perhaps it was a helicopter with a spotlight?  Then my periphery, an easily identifiable airplane was also crossing the sky. Two blinking lights, white and red. Traveling toward the general area that the mysterious object occupied. I went back to watching the strange light, only for a few seconds more; in an instant it vanished. As the light suddenly cut out, in the exact same spot; a barely visible red light zipped to the right, much more horizontal than vertical. The speed in which this tiny red light moved was frightening at first glance, it reminded me of how one sees a meteorite zipping across the atmosphere before burning out. It moved so quickly and was so faint that I lost sight of it. Its hard to estimate the exact distance and direction of the object, but if I was to get as close as I could;  From the horizon it was approximately 20 degrees vertical.  On a 360 Degree compass, it was approximately 15 degrees clockwise of due West.  I can't give an accurate estimation of distance seeing as it was only a light, but if I was to guess based on gut feeling, I would bet about 15 to 20 miles or so as the bird flies",

     "text":"3 Amber Orbs Spotted Over Rural Area in Midwest Sighting(s) occurred June 3, 2011. My boyfriend and I were going to take a walk through my neighborhood at approximately 10 pm, Central Time.  We walked about 20 minutes before deciding to sit in an empty lot to talk and look at the night sky. After about 5 minutes of standing and looking up at the sky, I noticed a very bright, amber star in the West.  After pointing it out, I quickly noticed that it was traveling fairly quickly.   The two of us got excited, as we assumed it was a shooting star or a comet.   As it neared where we were, I vaguely noticed that it didn't seem to be descending accelerating, or extinguishing, as many space-borne objects will.  The \"comet\" continued in a steady, unfaltering path across the night towards the East.   As we continued to watch, we noticed that the object seemed to flicker very consistently, and was orb-like in nature.  This last detail is what made us question that we were seeing some meteor or shooting star.  Usually those seem to have a \"tail\" and move quicker.  My boyfriend suggested it was likely some sort of plane or helicopter.  My father, however, is an Air Traffic Controller, and has been for over 30 years.  So I am fairly familiar with what different types of aircraft look like their markers, shapes, and flight patterns, air spaces, etc.- even at night.  I assured him we had not seen a plane; I knew that for absolutely certain.  (Not to mention, there were other airplanes in the area, or closer to the airport, that appeared normal and could also serve as a good reference.)   So as this thing vanished into the horizon, we just brushed it off as some odd piece of space debris that had gotten caught in orbit or some loose ashes from a nearby bonfire (even though, in hindsight, I now realize that there was no smoke to be seen or smelled, and the night was absent of fire crackling, or people enjoying a fire)  As we were sitting together in the grass 5-10 minutes later, I spotted yet another object, identical to the other in every way (physical description, speed, height, size, etc.) coming across the sky from the same origin point in the West.   This time we studied the object with more scrutiny, as we had been intrigued by the irregularities of the previous.  \"Maybe we‚Äôre looking at the beginning of a meteor shower!\" I briefly thought, as sometimes you will see a couple before the majority appears.  But it was still a little odd, if it were that.   As we watched the thing float above our heads in its steady, silent path my boyfriend even suggested that the object was perhaps someone flying some sort of remote-controlled toy with a light.  I know better though, as my father (being pretty interested in aerial flight as a whole) has made and flown his own remote-controlled airplanes for decades, and our family has gone to a few RC clubs and flights.  By now, being halfway across the sky, this strange orb was fitting absolutely no description of anything I had ever recognized.  It was a completely ginger-hued orb that seemed to enclose some sort of flickering light, much like the flame on a candle.  It seems to be consistently traveling at a fairly low altitude, and had a straight, steady flight pattern.  We also both noticed that both objects had been entirely silent.  It also had no \"exterior\" or extra lights; it was simply an orange flickering sphere.  It did not have a tail, it did not accelerate or decelerate; it didn‚Äôt falter in its size, height, speed, or trajectory.   Suddenly during our examination, the object just shut off.  It didn‚Äôt fade out; nothing like that.  It just \"shut off\" like a switch.  This is when I started to get really interested.  No ashes, comets or stars, and certainly not aircraft!  An aircraft would just shut off like that so abruptly midair. My boyfriend and I looked at each other with confusion and curiosity.  \"We just saw our first UFO!\"  He laughed jokingly, since he is well aware of the fact that I do not believe in UFO‚Äôs, like much of pop culture, with notions flying saucers and little green guys.  I believe, being the daughter of a devout Christian and Air Traffic Controller, in the term \"UFO\" in the strict definition of an \"unidentified flying object,\" and nothing more.   And, as a side note, even in 30+ years as an ATC for O‚ÄôHare International Airport in Chicago, my father has never had or seen a report of a UFO that they could not identify soon after its sighting.  But I digress.   Needless to say, I was completely dumbfounded by the objects we were seeing, and both my boyfriend and I were intrigued to say the least.  But what were the chances of seeing one, let alone two, strange things in the sky?  We laughed about it, and commented on how cool it was, but as our conversation continued it also swung back into normalcy. About 20 minutes later (probably about 10:50 pm, if I were to guess) a couple of clouds began to cover the sky, coming from the southwest.  With the stars disappearing and bugs beginning to nip at me more and more, I was thinking of beginning to head back home.   But before we could even stand to go, I saw something- again!  One of the SAME \"somethings,\" again.   I jumped up, mid-conversation, and franticly pointed out yet another airborne object to my boyfriend.  This time the orb seemed closer to the ground and/or bigger in size, and the flickering light was more defined.  Everything else, however, was eerily the same; spherical shape, silent, steady.   When reached the same air space with the clouds, it went right through them, absolutely undisturbed by them.   Just then, my boyfriend whipped out his cell phone, and tried to capture a picture, to no avail.  But I couldn‚Äôt move; my heart had stopped.  No flaming object, from inside or outside of earth‚Äôs orbit should be able to go through such a dense cloud without even a slight alteration in appearance or behavior.  But no, it flew right through the clouds as if a plane would.  (Though I knew it wasn‚Äôt one- and even planes can be affected by impacting clouds- turbulence, anyone?)   Also, the latest observation made me realize that this thing couldn‚Äôt be that far off.  If it‚Äôs cruising through a cloud-layer, this thing IS in our atmosphere so SHOULD not have such a stable, controlled path.   My heart began to pound.  When it was directly overhead (and well-clear of the clouds) it shut off abruptly.  It seemed to be lost or gone.  But when I spotted it a split-second later, I yelped and grabbed my boyfriend‚Äôs hand.  It appeared to be a completely black, saucer just hovering in the air.   It stood stationary for an instant, before \"bucking\" (much like a manual car switching gears at high speed) and then rapidly accelerating.  It had accelerated most definitely, but was still continuing on the same steady, unfaltering path, and never seemed to ascend or descend, similarly to the others.!   I don‚Äôt know where it went or what happened to it after that.  We were running home as fast as we could, the hairs on our body standing on end. After reaching the house out of breath, and hastily telling family members what we witnessed (mostly a skeptical audience, I think), my boyfriend went back to the same place to try and capture footage.  He was there for about a half hour, and was unfortunately unable to see or capture anything else. To the best of my knowledge, this was not any well-known aircraft, any comet, asteroid, or meteor, any ash from a fire...  It just was nothing I‚Äôve ever seen.  I even looked online to see if there was any meteor, asteroid, etc. activity expected or spotted in the area for that time, and there was absolutely nothing.    So far, though, one of my neighbors has confirmed that she saw the activity as well, but then again I have heard nothing else from anyone else or read any news articles about the instance. And, yes, we were sober, and no I don‚Äôt (or didn‚Äôt, perhaps) even believe in \"extraterrestrial activity,\" so this is not wishful thinking, or an overactive imagination.  Even my boyfriend, who is fascinated with anything bizarre or scary, was terrified- and I have never seen him even remotely as scared in the 3 years we have been dating.",

This event changed everything for me...  Later that year my wife left with the kids, followd by a nasty divorce.  I tried to forget what I know I saw...  for 10 years I made it, working nightly in the same outdoor welding shop that I was working in, on THAT night. The guy on the radio starts talking about the upcoming 10 anniversary of the \"Phx Lights\" mass sighting, and it was like a switch in my head came on.  I was instantly awakened...  no longer can I hold back on what I saw, and it has become an obsession.  I then reported my story on any ufo website that had the ability.  That's been a few years now and I have yet to be interviewed on what I saw. The vision of the massive yet elegant airshow that was displayed to those who were watching that night, will continue to play on my head like no other memory I can think of.  As I watched it silently make a banked turn as it glided gracefully at the same elevation (or below) as the South Mtn range that it was effortlessly floating along as it flew away from me.  When I first saw it, it was floating over the S.East end if the airport area, and it was in a semicircle pattern about 5 miles wide.  Each of the orbs that made up the outline could move individually (and a few did).  The light of each orange/red orb came from within and didn't radiate out (like molten metal).  The orbs started moving and formed into a V shape with one side lopsided by on or 2 orbs.  when it pivoted to start moving the orb in the middle became the nose of the now V craft and when it pointed as if it were going to come my way...  I panicked and turned to run...  I then realized that this thing my be 9 miles away from me.  I turned back around and instantly my fear was gone and as I watched it for the next 15 minutes, I tried not to blink, as I didn't want to miss a second of it.  I then told a few people and mentioned it to my wife, and it lay dormant in my head until t! he hype of the 10 year anniverssary of it brought it all back. The \"flare\" explaination is insulting to my intelligence...  I've lived here in the Phx valley all my 52 years and have seen my share of flare drops...  Not even close.  We have nothing on this earth (maybe inside it or interdimentionally) that could put on a show like we saw in Phx that night.",

     "text":"Dove Shaped Ships that Glowed Green in mid-1970s While laying on the flat roof in our backyard one evening in the mid-1970s, I saw three glowing neon green ships glide over our property in Reseda, CA.  I was about 13 years old at the time.  The ships were traveling from West to East and took approximately eight seconds to pass completely overhead, until they became obscured by a row of large trees at the East end of our property. The three ships were flying in a V formation and were identical to each other in shape, size and color. They were shaped like birds; similar in shape to the dove logo used on \"Dove\" soap.  The  nose at the front of each ship was turned slightly downward, as were the wings; with one wing located at each side of each ship.  The tail on each ship was turned slightly upward and was slightly pointed at its tip.  The ships made no sound and there were no blinking lights nor any other colors; only the bright, glowing neon green color which emanated from the ships. The surface of the ships were smooth, like glass.  I did not see any windows nor any other markings on the ships. I pinched my left arm very hard to make sure that I was not dreaming as the ships passed over me.  After the ships passed overhead and behind the trees, I climbed down from the roof and ran to the West end of our driveway to see if I could get another look at them over the tops of the trees but they were no longer visible. I ran inside and watched the news on TV that night and also for the next three nights and checked the newspapers too but no one ever mentioned these ships.  I went out onto the roof every chance I could for the next week or so and stared off into the sky, hoping to get another look, but the ships never appeared again. I have never heard of anyone else seeing ships like these on any UFO show.  I also did not see anyone on this web site mention seeing this type of ship.  It's always the same: saucers, triangles, cigars, orbs and the like. A few days after my sighting, I remember speaking with my father about it.  I was frustrated that I hadn't seen any news story about this amazing event.  My father said that I must have been dreaming. But I know that I was not dreaming and that I really did see these ships.  I was not intoxicated in any way and I know that what I saw was real.  The sighting was not due to some sort of psychological trauma either. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time, I guess. Years later,  I thought that it was strange that the ships I had seen back in 1975 had a shape very similar to the Concord, which did not enter commercial service until 1976.  The Concord was designed to travel at supersonic speeds, with the most aerodynamically efficient shape.  How could I have known what that shape should be at the age of 13, without ever having seen the Concord?   Although the nose of the ships I saw were pointed slightly downward like the Concord, the wings of the ships I saw were quite different.  They were more like a bird's wings that arced downward, which were slightly pointed at the tips, rather than the horizontal/flat shaped wings of the Concord.  Plus, the ships I saw made no sound, glowed green and flew in a V formation, so I am sure they were not Concords. If anyone else saw these type of ships, I would love to hear from you, as I feel like a freak amongst UFO witnesses and that is a very sad thing.

Since I had a few moments, I stepped outside to feel the morning air, I noticed a fairly bright \"Star\" to the West of the warehouse where I stood. The \"Star\" was larger than the average star on this early morning, it had a reddish orange hue, and flickered every so slightly. I assumed that it was Mars, just peeking out over the rooftops. I downloaded the Skymaps app last week, so I open the app expecting the object to be Mars. However, nothing celestial was in that vicinity, especially not something that bright. My second logical assumption was that it was an aircraft, or perhaps a satellite; however unusual, since the light was as bright as Mars typically is. I watched the object and was able to realize that it was in fact moving. However, it was behaving erratically. Up up up, to the right, wobble, up up up, to the right, wobble; ever so slightly. Perhaps it was a helicopter with a spotlight?  Then my periphery, an easily identifiable airplane was also crossing the sky.  Two blinking lights, white and red. Traveling toward the general area that the mysterious object occupied. I went back to watching the strange light, only for a few seconds more; in an instant it vanished.  As the light suddenly cut out, in the exact same spot; a barely visible red light zipped to the right, much more horizontal than vertical.  The speed in which this tiny red light moved was frightening at first glance, it reminded me of how one sees a meteorite zipping across the atmosphere before burning out. It moved so quickly and was so faint that I lost sight of it. Its hard to estimate the exact distance and direction of the object, but if I was to get as close as I could;  From the horizon it was approximately 20 degrees vertical.  On a 360 Degree compass, it was approximately 15 degrees clockwise of due West.  I can't give an accurate estimation of distance seeing as it was only a light, but if I was to guess based on gut feeling,  I would bet about 15 to 20 miles or so as the bird flies.",

Conditions:  Around midnight, pretty sure the skies were clear, with no Delta Breeze at all. Location:  Between South Sacramento and Elk Grove  A friend and I were southbound on Elk Grove Florin Road approaching the stop sign at Calvine Road slowing on approach to the stop sign.  Nothing out there except a house on south/west corner, two story right on the corner.  Green light from source about 20 feet above second story beaming a trapezoid shape of same light down on back of house and back yard.  We could see the trees behind the house, the light waving off of the peak of the house like a mirage, or heat off the hood of a car.  I was staring into &quot;source&quot; that was around 30ft x 12ft. I was looking into the rectangle to see equipment, or anything but it was just pure lime green light, saw nothing. Also, we did not see a shape, lights, a craft, nothing.  Not even sound.  Then I got out of my car and by the time I looked back up it was gone, however the little street light that lit up the little 4 way stop was illuminating a/an \"exhaust cloud\", \"churned up atmosphere\", or what I call the &quot;Doughnut shaped cloud that the Road Runner leaves when he splits.&quot;  This &quot;cloud&quot; was floating at a 45 degree angle and if the &quot;Road Runner&quot; just &quot;split&quot; the trajectory of the object was South/Southwest (If Calvine is true East/West).  We watched this &quot;cloud&quot; or &quot;vapor&quot; float for about 20 seconds before 2 fighter jets buzzed us from Mather Air Base.  Some seconds later or minutes, came the rumble of a C-130 or AWAX, something obviously bigger and slower than the fighter jets inbound on the same course as the fighter jets, eventually coming overhead and continuing Southeast. No other cars were at the intersection, not much traffic at all on the roads in that area at that time back then.  We got in my car and left, turned on the radio and heard DJ's saying people calling in from all over the Sacramento area with sightings. Next day evening news said, &quot;We looked into the sightings from last night and spoke to (Naval Command?) and confirmed that it was a test missile launch from the San Fransisco area.&quot;  My friend's dad flew the (T-42?) trainer jet out of Mather, a side by side 2 seater jet for training new pilots.  He said to his dad that we had still not stopped talking about what we saw and after asking his dad what it was his reply was, &quot;I cannot tell you what it was, but what I can tell you is that it wasn't a missile launch from San Fransisco.&quot;  Since then, I've studied Ufology, and seen almost every video, and read a pile of sighting stories and I still haven't read or seen anything I saw that night.  After years and years of study, and cutting away the media fat, smoke and mirrors and separating information from mis-information and dis-information I'm about 98% convinced that what we saw was either a multi-dimensional craft, or this realm/dimension simply opening up to the other side.  The latter is from a total lack of observing any craft, or lights, or sound at all.

My friend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette around 11:00 PM 11/26 and witnessed a light circling around in the sky above my backyard. I also woke my mother up to see it, as well.   At first we thought it may be a spotlight (a new club opening up or something), but the center of the activity was in a strictly residential suburbian area and the light changed its course, moving eradically slow then fast and not in a perfect circle, sometimes a square or triangular course, and small then bigger ellipses, but always clockwise.  We could see no beams coming from the ground either, and the light seemed to be radiating parallel to the ground from an invisible object.  (It seems to beam out some at the right and left sides of the circumference, the course being mostly elliptical.)  It is now after 4:00 am 11/27, and the light is still there circling.   Last I checked I saw other light trailing it.  It was breaking in two at the middle of the course (bottom of ellipse) and then the smaller light followed it to the left and upward.  Kind of like the Atari game \"Breakout\" where it is guided.  Does that make sense?  It moved slow then fast like that.  And, the main light surged, too.  Like I said, it seemed to radiate from a center point above the clouds.   I also saw the light skip and appear further along the circumference immediately several times!  The light is not circular, but hazy (even inbetween the clouds where it is clear sky) and shapeless.  Not like any spotlight I‚Äôve ever seen, and it‚Äôs in the middle of the night and has been going on for five hours.  Also, it held it‚Äôs position when we went to the front of the house, seemed to be circling over us at the same place as in the backyard.  So, it must have been pretty far away and high up over the clouds.   I hope this makes sense; I‚Äôve tried to give as accurate of a description as possible.  I tried to capture it on camera, but it was too dark to pick anything up (maybe I just don't know how to use the thing!)",

At 8:05 PM, about 30 minutes after sundown my wife and I were in the back yard.  The sky was clear, half moon very bright.  Light from the sun was still glowing in the western half of the sky.  No stars were visible yet. My wife pointed to a very bright star almost directly overhead.  It was a Venus type brightness.  I realized that it was too early for stars and is Venus currently visible at dawn.  I then assumed it was a satellite reflecting sunlight which we often see.  I quickly realized if it was a satellite it had to very large, like the International Space Station which we are familiar with.  The ISS is not visible for us at this time.   I immediately recognized the ‚Äústar‚Äù object was not a satellite because it seemed stationary almost directly overhead.  It was absolutely not moving across the mid-point of the sky at the pace we often seen evening satellites moving. Looking at the object for ten plus seconds it suddenly became several times brighter.  The new brightness lasted about five seconds and then quickly dimmed to less brightness than it was originally.   A few seconds later a white cloud appeared around the star like object.   We describe the size of the cloud as 20-30 diameters of the ‚Äústar‚Äù object.  I arrived at that diameter simulating the size of the ‚Äústar‚Äù object with an ink dot and thereby extrapolating the size of the cloud.  The cloud was semitransparent rather that a very solid white; however it was definitely white.   Suddenly a bright ‚Äústar‚Äù like object moved out of the cloud area at an angle to the right and from our perspective it appeared to be moving downward as if falling toward earth.  The ‚Äúfalling‚Äù object was far less bright than the original object. I had my cell phone in hand so I dialed 911 to report the sighting in case it was some type of high altitude explosion.  The cloud and falling object were visible as I made contact with the 911 operator and gave my report.  The cloud and then the object faded from view while I was still on the phone, which I assume was about a minute. I checked the exact time of the sighting by my cell phone record of the 911 call. After the sighting faded, I looked around in the sky and because of the fading sunlight, there were no stars or planets visible.",

Out of habit, we both always end up looking at the sky in the evening in hopes of seeing a falling star, which is what we were doing at this point.  Suddenly, there it was. I yelled, \"Money, money, money\" as is my custom when I see a falling star, however, I realized before I even said the third \"money\" that this was not a falling star at all. When I first saw it, it was coming down fast, like a falling star would, but it kept coming, and it was getting bigger, and it had no tail, flame, or anything I've ever seen before. And before I could even blink, it was there, maybe 3 or 4 football field lengths above our house. It was an amber color, and it was shaped like a tylenol capsule. It was huge. It was giving off this amber light, yet, it wasn't like any kind of light I have ever seen in my life. It seemed to absorb the light around us as much as it seemed to be giving off the light as well. I realize this makes little sense, however, I am at a lack of words to explain it.  It stayed there. I have no idea how long. I ran out further into the yard when it then sped toward the center of the town we live in. We have a lot of trees in our yard which blocked my view, so I ran out into the street to see where it was. We have a building here, it's the tallest I believe in our town, and this craft hovered there above it. Again, I don't know how long it did, but it seemed about a minute. Then suddenly, it shot straight back up and utterly disappeared.  I do not know what this was. We immediantly came back inside, and went to a few sites that forcast or inform about any celestial happenings in the sky such as meteor showers, auroroa borealis, etc.. and there was nothing. Nothing at all that was reported to happen that night. I just wish I understood what it was that we saw that night.

     "text":"Strobing light, multiple colours, near Maniwaki, P.Q. (130kms North of Ottawa) Around 0030 hours on Thursday, November 19th 2009, I went outside to smoke a cigarette and a bright white light caught my attention; it was distinctly brighter than everything else in the sky. As I paid closer attention to it I noticed a sort of red light emanating from one of its sides and a bluish hue that seemed to be on the underside of the object. It appeared to be hovering but was not completely stationary, it kept repeating a kind of circular, or wave pattern, at regular interval, about every two or three minutes. I was puzzled by it and ended up staying outside for 45 minutes-or-so, observing it circle around in a similar fashion to a mosquito, or a fly, or something.  It was getting cold, so I decided to go back inside to get binoculars or something but I don‚Äôt have very powerful ones so figured they would not be of much use. I went back outside less than an hour later (around 01:45) and, to my surprise, the object was still there hovering around. The white light was still bright but the red and blue ones had become intermittent, only visible for short periods of time over several minutes; the predominant light (white one) appeared to have acquired a yellowish-orange color. (The first time I was outside it remained a very bright, clear, white; aside from the red and blue lights/reflections or whatever they were)  The object appeared to be so far, and high up, I can‚Äôt even estimate the distance or the altitude other than it was a good couple kilometers up in the sky and at least 15kms away from my position. I don‚Äôt really know what to say about the shape because it didn‚Äôt always look the same: sometimes the bright white light was shaped kind of like the letter ‚ÄúC‚Äù, sometimes it looked more triangular in form and the rest of the time like a cylinder standing on its end. There did seem to be two distinct parts to the object, though, like there was something obstructing the light in the middle?? At some point when it was closer the first time I saw it, I thought I saw like a kind of pompon on the top but I wasn‚Äôt able to see that again so it could have been some effect with the light. Also, the main light was throbbing, it would get a little dimmer and become bright again; this cycle lasted about 1 or 2 seconds, like a kid flipping a light switch continuously (this was observable the who! le time).  The sky was completely clear: I observed numerous meteorites entering the atmosphere and burning up and at least one plane (what appeared to me as being a commercial passenger aircraft) that seemed to get pretty close to the object, albeit a considerable distance below it. Around 0300 hours I decided to get back inside as the object had not done anything else than dim/brighten and enter hovering patterns in the previously stated fashion. There was no audible sound whatsoever from the object.",

I was driving North on I-95, at about 23:50.  I saw a light flash in the sky out of the corner of my eye, so I turned my head slightly to the left, expecting to see a shooting star.  To my surprise, it was a green ball of light, much larger than any star.  I watched it move a very short distance quickly from left to right, and then it stopped.   After only being stopped for one second, it seemed to pull back a little and then sped off in the same direction it was headed.  It was visible for only another second or two and them it seemed to disappear into nothing.  It did not have a tail and it was too far away to make out any physical features other than just that it was round.   When I got home, I was a little shaken up, but I wasn‚Äôt convinced I had seen an alien spaceship.  The next morning, however, (yesterday) I woke up extremely sore. Looking more into aliens and UFOs, I found that could mean possible alien contact.   Also I have had this strange bump on my left ring finger that randomly appeared a few months ago.  It doesn‚Äôt hurt but I constantly play with it, and my doctor said it was nothing.  It doesn‚Äôt show up in X-rays.  All of this could of course be random, weird coincidences, and really I still don‚Äôt know if I believe in all of it, but I figured it was worth sharing with people who have heard a lot of these stories.",

The other witness is my girlfriend, a paralegal, age 23. We were driving to our 7:30 dinner reservation, which we were late for, and as I was going along my street I saw a bright star off to my left. I'm always looking out for ufos so I made some comment about this star to my girlfriend, and she replied to stop looking at it and look where I was driving.  At the next intersection I turned left, and now the object was in the sky in front of us (and slightly left of the road). The light had grown and now it was no longer a star, but many blinking lights. Its altitude in the sky was much lower than a plane, maybe between 500 and 1000 feet up. My first thought was \"Damn that thing has lots of lights\" but I actually wrote it off as a plane because my eyesight is poor and I couldn't see any detail. Then a few seconds later my girlfriend (whose eyesight is better than mine) said \"What IS that thing?\" I looked over at it again and I asked her to tell me what she was seeing. She could actually see the solid object and said it was grey and egg shaped, and covered with blinking lights. It was flying about as fast as a plane or a helicopter, but erratically. I could see the blinking lights, which were multicolored (there were at least a dozen lights to my reckoning), but my eyesight was not good enough to discern the shape.  By this time it had flown further to our left. I said \"screw the reservation!\" and I took the next left to follow it. The trees obscured our view temporarily but I drove in the direction that it was in the sky. As soon as we got to a clearer view, the object was nowhere to be seen. We were both very baffled, because it should've been visible in the sky.",

Saturday ‚Äì January 14, 2012 @ approx. 18:00-18:05 HH North Underhill, Vermont Weather conditions: Clear to partly cloudy, calm, very cold 0 to -5¬∞F    I arrived home at around 5:30PM and was in and out of the house unloading my car.  Around 6:00 PM I went outside to my deck to get firewood and noticed 3 dull orange-red lights, solid not blinking, fairly high in the northeast sky.  Triangular pattern 2 on top 1 below, all moving differently, up and down, side to side, fairly slowly.  I assumed they were helicopters or planes but as I watched them their movements were not consistent with a plane, maybe a helicopter.  They seemed to be a fair distance away, not overhead. We have a large government artillery range about 10 miles south of me so it‚Äôs not uncommon to see helicopters flying at night. As I watched them, suddenly, a cluster of the same type of lights appears west of the lights I just described, in the north sky, very low on the horizon.  The cluster had probably 8-12 lights and was in an ellipse type random formation and they all appeared at once. The first set of lights didn‚Äôt surprise me that much but when I saw this second group I was very puzzled, it was like nothing I had ever seen before.  I called my neighbor who lives +/- 600‚Äô south of me and told her to go outside.  She said she could see the 3 up high but I think my house was in the way of the large cluster.  As I was talking to her the larger cluster was fading in and out, always visible and very bright at times, they were visible for a couple minutes and they didn‚Äôt move up or down, they seemed to stay in one place.  Then they all just faded away and disappeared. The color of these lights were nothing like I‚Äôve ever witnessed before orange-red, almost rust color.  Not blinking but they kind of twinkled.  As I watched them, stars were visible but I believe there was also some thin cloud cover because the stars were not bright like they would be here on a clear night. I live in a fairly remote area with minimal light pollution and I didn‚Äôt hear any noise associated with what I saw. A friend checked the notice to airman and temporary flight restrictions for our area and there were none.",

The shape of the object was similar to a Chinese lantern laying on its side; the center was clearly defined by a built-in skeleton th! at resembled raised tubing on its shimmering surface.  Above this visible division was a row of black that I could not make out as compartmentalized in any way; it appeared to be a consistent strip around. After about two minutes the secondary craft began to orbit around the primary one slowly, to which it went around twice and then stopped, mid-rotation, in the exact spot it had originally appeared, on the reverse side.  The duration of the rotations was approx. one minute, forty-five seconds.  I was timing as best I could with my watch.  The two drew together and separated three times in the same straight line position and then stopped moving.  They sat there for approx. 6 minutes, and then started to drift away, but slowly. It was another 8 minutes or so until I could not longer see them. I came back inside the house and drank some water, talked to my mother regarding the situation and found a hotline to report sightings.  I called and they suggested I submit my written report to document the sighting.  Here it is. I only wish I had a camera to document, but now I know that and will try to have something immediately available.  This is not the first sighting I have encountered, but it is the first I have reported.

UFO above I-40 between Old Fort and West Morganton, North Carolina.  At 10 pm, last Sunday night, October 26, 2014, I was driving I-40 east-bound on my way home to Rocky Mount from a weekend checking on my elderly mom in Hendersonville, NC.  I left at 6:30 pm, took 26 west in heavy traffic to Asheville by 7PM, and then took 40 east.  I came over the Black Mountain Pass and stopped at the Old Fort McDonald‚Äôs for a quick break and was back on the road about 8:00 pm.  It was dark by then. I drove east on I-40 for about half an hour, when suddenly I noticed above me and ahead of me the thick edge of a brightly shining luminous white disk hanging in the night sky.  It was very high up, but right over the road.  It did not move.  The dashboard clock said 10 PM!  What!????  I was between a steep mountain ridge paralleling the road on my right, to the south, and a hillside to the north.  Both sides of the road were heavily wooded as far as I could see in the dark.  I could not see any houses or lights anywhere.  I looked for a mile marker, but didn‚Äôt find one. The object was amazing.  It was as if I Iooked straight on to the side of a doughnut, then lifted it up to about an 11:00 position.  I could see the brilliant white light and the thick wide curves of the right and left sides.  I drove under it a few minutes later, with some trepidation.  I thought the object might be a reflection of some sort off the windshield, so I opened the sunroof completely, sliding the glass back all the way.  Looking up thru the open sunroof, I could see that it was a perfect white circle with three very bright green circular lights under it.  The three green lights clustered in the center together, quite pretty.  They looked exactly like the three circular razors on the head of an electric Norelco razor.  Neither the white object nor the three green lights beneath it appeared to spin, move, or rotate, though.  There was no sound or vibration.  It was not a balloon. What was it?  The atmosphere was clear and not misty or foggy, so there were no perceptible light beams through the air.  There was not wind that night. I thought it might be a house on the mountain to my right.  However, the mountain was very steep and I could see the darker ridge line lower down to my right against the sky, farther away.  There were no lights on the mountain. So the brilliant light was not coming from anything on the mountain itself.  It was above me and not over on the mountain.  To my left was the west bound lane and heavy woods and trees and another steep slope whose top I could not see for the trees.  There were no lights to my left either. Above me, there were no clouds in the sky.  The object was against a starry sky. The moon was up that night, but it was to the south-southwest, according to the moon app on my cell phone, and it was out of my vision range, south of the high mountain ridge to my right somewhere.  The bright object was definitely not the moon or any planet.  It was way too big for that.  The light was brilliant, but not blinding.  If I put my hands up and held them about a foot apart, that‚Äôs how big it appeared when I first saw it, as I approached it. Looking up through the open sunroof, I heard no sound and did not feel anything.  The object was completely still in the air, not moving, not rotating, just hovering up above and very slightly off to the side, to the right/south of I-40.  It was lower than the mountain ridge to my right.  It was closer to the road than to the mountain.  As I drove under it, I was a little scared, but nothing happened.  I would say it was at about the 1:00 position above the highway.  There was no other traffic around me on the east bound lane.  Since I was looking up, I didn‚Äôt notice if there was any traffic coming toward me on the west bound lane.  I passed a small unlit exit on my right leading downwards to the south, but passed it too quickly to catch the number.  Then, I came into trucks and had to take my eyes away. When I looked back, I couldn‚Äôt see the object anymore because the road curved. I came up to the Morganton exit, several minutes after I saw the object. I don‚Äôt know how to explain the missing time between 8:30 and 10:00 pm. It doesn‚Äôt take an hour and a half to drive between Old Fort and Morganton!  I was driving between 65 and 70 miles an hour, so I couldn‚Äôt have fallen asleep.  I left Asheville at about 7pm, and Old Fort about 8:00, so I should have been past Statesville by 10 PM.  My dashboard clock is accurate. I will be 67 this month.  I am a retired school teacher and live near Rocky Mount, NC.  I don‚Äôt smoke, drink, do drugs, or mess around.  I have backpacked around the world twice and am an avid hiker and trekker.  As a teacher, I am rational, objective, and factual.  I don‚Äôt believe in UFO‚Äôs.  I have never seen one.  However, I try to keep an open mind and entertain possibilities without judgment. What did I see?  And what happened to me in the missing hour and a half?  Perhaps I made a mistake?  I think I will make the drive again soon and double check the time and my position.  I know that steep mountain ridge, just not sure exactly where it is.  I tried to check on Google Earth, but it does not give elevations, so I could not tell exactly where I was.  Surely, there must be an explanation.  I have reported the incident to the Superintendent of the Burke County Sheriff's office.  She told me that she would report it to the airport management for Burke County Airport. Photo?  My phone was dead and charging, but it would have been dangerous to do while driving, and I didn‚Äôt feel safe stopping that late at night in such a location.  Frankly, I MUST have seen a UFO, what else could it have been?  Yes, I have lost time twice before that I know of; once at twelve years old and once in India in 1976.  I have no explanation.  I experienced a great sense of urgency both times, but don't know why. ‚ÄúThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophies.‚Äù  Hamlet, Scene V -W.

I would like to start by saying that I have never seen an unidentified flying object before that I could not quickly explain away as something explainable. On August 20th, 2007 at 9:50 p.m. I stepped out on my deck to have a cigarette. We just had our first real rainy day of the summer and the evening sky was mostly cloudy, but clearing up. I noticed the moon partially obscured through the clouds to the southwest looking from Lafayette Oregon south-southwest towards but between if you will, McMinnville and Salem Oregon. The moon was not a full moon, but a quarter moon and it was low in the sky. Directly to the west-northwest of the moon in the sky there was a large break ‚ÄúSpot or Hole‚Äù in the clouds where I could clearly make out or see the stars. I would say that this break in the sky was approximately 3 to 4 miles long by 2 to 3 miles across. I was just about to light my cigarette while looking at the stars through the break in the clouds when I saw a large Oval shaped object move very fast from west to east across the break in the clouds. The oval object was a solid white to aqua blue in color. Not transparent. No flashing lights could be seen associated with this oval object. This object moved very quickly across the break in the clouds. I quickly tried to explain it away when, a second large oval object of the same description moved very quickly across the break in the clouds in the same direction. I do not feel that what I saw was something normally seen in the night sky. I.E. a satellite or commercial jet aircraft. These object were moving way to fast. Closing notes: Each object was seen for about 8 to 10 seconds.  In my opinion I feel that these objects were Not personal aircraft, military aircraft, commercial aircraft, shooting stars, or satellites. These oval objects were larger then commercial aircraft by a least two fold. No sounds could be heard I.E. engine sounds. There were no ‚ÄúFlashing Lights‚Äù associated to these objects. There were no ‚ÄúStreaks‚Äù of light trailing these objects. I would place these oval objects at 5 to 10 thousand feet in altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and STS??  PD))",

     "text":"Bright blue, fast, UFOs passing over I-10. During the first second of the sighting:  I was driving alone on I-10 East about 8.5 miles due East of Kerrville, TX, (30¬∞ 02' 40\" N 98¬∞ 59' 46\" W), when I saw a bright blue UFO off to my right (SSW).  It was moving extremely fast, 3000 to 4000 MPH, at about 1000 - 1500 feet altitude.  Nothing was visible behind it to provide scale for altitude, but from previous experiences, I assumed it was an average sized UFO, 30' to 50' in diameter.  The speed I determined with Google Earth, from where I first saw it to where it changed direction was about 3 miles in about 3 seconds. The next two seconds:  As it came closer and passed over I-10 and off to my left I realized it was actually two bright blue lights. The next second:  At that point it appeared to reverse direction and come straight at me, my heart stopped for a split second from memories of previous experiences.  It was actually two of them, side by side until they split.  To me, the two lights turning different directions made it appear as if only one UFO was coming straight at me super fast for a split second. The last two seconds:  The one going north went out of sight behind me, I watched as the other one increased speed and disappeared in the distance over the hills, about 3 miles away. That's it.  As for me, I have an IQ around 150, common sense, and my hobby is knowledge of all sciences, religions, legends, myths and secrets.  Astronomy has been my favorite for over 40 years and advanced technology of any type is a close second.  I know what Venus, a satellite, etc. are. My first sighting I won't talk much about, memories start coming back I don't want.  I was 7, hunting squirrels with a semi-auto .22 rifle.  I crawled up to a clearing to watch for squirrels and there were 3 Tall Whites, almost human looking with slightly larger craniums, not huge like grays.  They were standing beside a beautiful mirror finish UFO, almost invisible in the trees.  I was afraid, all movies showed aliens were evil invaders.  In an instant they disappeared and a stick and the leaves between them and me all jumped to new positions like a piece of film missing.   I walked back to camp thinking I had shot two squirrels, but couldn't shoot the third one because of the great sadness I felt coming from him as he looked at me.  It was his eyes, like squirrels eyes that made me remember the sticks and leaves and aliens and UFO.  And I didn't have the two squirrels I shot, I would never waste meat.   Later I remembered killing the two.  They were good, I was bad.  I can't think about it anymore, I don't want to know what happened.  I have encountered them many times since then, some just passing by, some with missing time, one with a grid of geometric shaped light bruises on the back of my upper arm, I told my family they took me again, showed them what they did, it was gone the next morning.  They took me at Boy Scout camp as a child, I watched three of them rapidly switch positions as they hovered before leaving, they were triangulating, triple checking and then I watched them go until they were one point of light that faded away towards a summer star, theirs maybe. They took me at a railroad crossing with an old style wooden arm across the highway in part of west Texas where there are no railroads for hundreds of miles.  That was 3 years ago, I am 59 now.  I don't know why they won't leave me alone but I think they want me to build something I saw in a dream as a child.  The last UFO was so bright everything looked different shades of white for hundreds of yards and it was about 3 A.M.  Maybe someday I will post abou! t the tw o secret space stations I found in my telescope and the MIB taking pictures that ran from me and the unmarked almost silent helicopter that hovered over my home and pointed a mini-gun at my wife and child while I was in the house, all within a few days.  I had threatened to release the Right Ascensions and Declinations.  I told them (MUFON, who turned me in) I didn't really know, I hadn't looked because I didn't align my telescope properly and I was just stargazing and stumbled across ships moving back and forth between them. I am rambling now, I'm sorry.  I don't trust the grays, they are fallen angels, enslavers of mankind.  The Tall Whites are Angels.  I don't give a crap if anyone believes me and never have.  I know what I have experienced, I just don't know what they want yet.",

     "text":"Skip/hop/dipping flying craft.  Reflective and bright white to completely clear (invisible). Saturday, May 30th, 2015,  Just to start off‚Ä¶  It was a warm day with a clear blue sky.  I was sitting facing somewhat South?  The object was moving South-West. I went out to the backyard to have a smoke on the porch.  After lighting my cigarette, I was just looking out over the street and saw what I first thought was a strip of cloth floating down across the street.  After a few seconds of examination, as it was falling slowly (swaying), its appearance was as such; really large, thin, kinda flimsy, kinda heavy, almost belt shaped, yellowish clear with burn marks on it, mica mineral-esque, kind of metallic?  But with cloth like properties.   Anyhow, I watched as it drifted downwards across the street and over the house next door.  My first thought was, ‚Äúthat was weird,‚Äù and then I began thinking, ‚ÄúWhere the hell could that have come from anyway?  Where could that have fallen from?‚Äù  I considered the angle, and it appeared to be falling in a way that it was much too heavy to have been picked up by the wind at all (there was only a slight breeze), as it was just drifting downwards.  My next thought was, ‚Äúwell whatever, that is just weird.‚Äù   I then started looking at the clouds, a few seconds after seeing the weird metallic/mica/cloth/burnt thing.  Immediately catching my eye was an incredible bright object a ways off in the sky overhead.  My first thought was, ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs a shiny plane.‚Äù  hah But it wasn‚Äôt shaped like a plane, and it immediately stopping reflecting light.  I thought I lost sight of it, but then it suddenly got extremely bright again.  To compare it to something, I‚Äôd have to say it was like just the bright spot on a mirror where it‚Äôs reflecting concentrated rays of light.  I didn‚Äôt think it was weird, as I thought it may just be a plane catching light at a certain angle while spinning or something.   Then as it continued forward (still suddenly really brightly reflecting then not being visible), I realized it wasn‚Äôt flying like a plane should fly either; it was kind of dipping down and then back up, and then down, and back up, in the same pattern (you know how they animate planes in cartoons that suddenly run out of gas and putter down and back up; kind of like that), but it was more skipping like a stone across the water.   So, now my brain is processing seeing a strange flying object that suddenly gets really bright and then invisible while skip-flying. It wasn‚Äôt like a plane diving down and back up. It was more like a wave riding, hopping motion.  Anyway, I immediately decided, ‚Äúthat can‚Äôt possibly be a plane, because it doesn‚Äôt look like a plane (doesn‚Äôt have much shape at all); it‚Äôs not spinning or twisting at all or doing anything in any way to reflect light so intensely in that very consistent pattern‚Ä¶‚Äù It couldn‚Äôt have been a balloon either, as there was no wind and it was moving quickly and everything else I have and will describe.  A balloon could not ascend and descend that quickly either, especially in that consistent pattern.   Its hopping/skipping/dipping pattern made me think of that of an extremely large bird with an extremely large wingspan; the way that the b! ody of the bird would dip as it thrusts its wings up and then ! down, but a slightly extended duration at great speed.  For a split second, I thought it might even be a really large bird, because of that, but it obviously was not a bird.  Birds do not shimmer, or turn invisible, or flap without wings, and they aren‚Äôt larger than planes, and aren‚Äôt shaped like weird squashed oval triangles.  It did not have wings or any specific shape.  The object also made no noise at all, and it didn‚Äôt leave any contrails, despite its speed.  I forgot to mention that the craft had no lights on it, other than the reflected bright white, and it wasn‚Äôt any other color but clear and bright white light.  It didn‚Äôt have any appendages or anything either. The object wasn‚Äôt aflame or anything.  It was just really extremely bright white reflected light. After blinking my eyes a couple times for a second something odd happened.  The object was apparently so bright that when closing my eyes it created the spot that you get after looking directly at a bright light (even though it had only been a few seconds).  This gave me a good idea of the shape of the ‚Äúcraft‚Äù I suppose.  It was like a stretched oval, kind of like a squashed very rounded obtuse triangle.  The shape was hard to discern as it became so bright. The surface appeared pure white, which is I‚Äôm guessing because of the crafts reflective properties. I have no idea.  I watched this skipping bright then invisible object for a couple minutes until it got to a good distance away. It was moving much faster than a plane at the height that it appeared to be. Another thought I had while I thought it might be a plane, before I noticed everything about it, was that it wasn‚Äôt heading down! . The first couple of skip/dips I thought might be plausible for a plane in turbulence that was suddenly damaged (though the sky was clear and no wind), but the pattern was exactly the same every time and the vanishing + reflecting really bright without spinning obviously made it clear that it wasn‚Äôt a plane. There was also no smoke or anything. It didn‚Äôt have a plane shape, and it was a consistently skipping/dipping really bright then invisible non-descending object. I‚Äôm super guessing that it was maybe about 2-5 miles up in the air. This was so astoundingly different and unexplainable that I actually wanted to report it on the national UFO sighting website. It happened. I saw it. Something presumably fell off of it and landed a few houses away (which there is no way I‚Äôm going to knock on my neighbors door down the way and ask if they have the weird metallic mica mineral like material that fell near their house). Afterwards, as I snuffed my cigarette out in the dirt, I jus! t thought, ‚ÄúWhatever, like the other random weird things peopl! e see in the sky; I‚Äôll just ignore it and go about my day. Unexplained stuff happens sometimes and I‚Äôm not going to jump to conclusions or get all tin foil hat about it.‚Äù Anyway, I thought it was over, I was just going to ignore it and whatever. I went back inside and got on my desktop computer. After about 15 minutes‚Ä¶.. Something happened. A loud BOOF shockwave like sonic boom sound and the house rattled. The power immediately went off. The pressure and the sound came from the direction that the unidentified skip/hop-flying bright then invisible thing was going. The power went out everywhere. 5 minutes after that there was another smaller pressure wave sound sonic boom-like thing from the same direction. It didn‚Äôt sound like an explosion. Both sounded like‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt know.... BUFF or BOOF? Haha Like a massive highly pressurized air pocket the size of a few football fields burst a few miles away? It‚Äôs hard to explain. Some of these details may sound like a hot air balloon, but in no way could a hot air balloon do exactly what I saw, or be made of the material that came from it, or create the massive BOOF (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm calling it now) and sh! ockwave that turns off electrical devices.  Everyone was outside asking one another if their power went out and whether they saw anything.  Everyone was looking around for smoke and checking all the transformers. None of them had blown. After about another 8-15 minutes, the power came back on of its own volition. The outage was reported to the local electric company and I checked their outage map. A couple thousand reported people in this area of the city were affected and a few stretching outwards from the direction of the BOOF. There were more concentrated outages closer to the direction of the wave. There aren‚Äôt any large transformers that power everyone around here in that direction that I know of. This was written within a few hours of them happening. The events transpired at some time between 3:20 pm and 5:50 pm. It is now 9:31 pm. The electricity company reports that the cause of the outage is unknown and still under investigation. All these unexplained concurrent events could just be highly unlikely coincidences. Murphy‚Äôs law, so whatever I guess? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

Our first thoughts were that it was a plane crashing, but we saw no explosion; it just vanished. We heard no sound and no residue coming from the location of the object.

At 9:40pm this evening, while standing on my steps, I was looking towards the eastern sky when I witnessed 3 large amber lights, they were all symmetrical to one another and evenly spaced apart.  The lights were much larger than any star and I would compare the total width of the 3 lights in a row to that of a full moon that is just rising up. (When the moon is brighter orange and appears to sit just above tree top levels.)  I watched the bright amber lights rotate towards the north, (my left facing east) and witnessed another complete set of 3 amber lights, with the rotation the lights appeared to stay within the same proximity of one another and also appeared to be what I would say part of the same ‚Äúcraft‚Äù, being the one set of lights rotated around out of my sight and another set appeared. I witnessed the bright amber lights for approximately 15 seconds, and just as the lights had rotated I witnessed 3 or 4 smaller white lights, what would appear the size of a star in the sky, these white lights were moving around very erratically in the same general area of the amber lights. After contacting the National UFO Reporting Center, I contacted the local law enforcement and was informed by the deputy sheriff that he had also witnessed the same lights as well as another witness that was in his squad car at the time.  The sheriff‚Äôs location at the time of the sighting was approximately 12-17 miles east north east of my location, and he witnessed the lights to the west of his location.

     "text":"A short accounting of this even written for a memoirs class. UFO Sightings The sky was black‚Äîone of those moonless nights with crisp air and unending visibility.  If memory serves me it was early in the winter of 1974. I had just concluded a late-evening insurance appointment on Grantland Avenue west of highway 99 in Fresno, CA. Between 9:30 and 10:00 o‚Äôclock, I headed for my home in Rolling Hills on the Madera County side of the San Joaquin River.  The most direct route from Grantland Avenue was to take Herndon Avenue east to Blackstone and then north on Highway 41 to Avenue 10. A mile or so west of the Sierra Sky Park I noticed what looked like an airplane, roughly 500 feet above the ground preparing to land at the tiny airstrip.  Small planes landing here were not uncommon so I paid little attention to it.  But I did notice that its rate of descent was considerably slower than an airplane.  Maybe it‚Äôs traveling toward me, I reasoned.  The closer I got to the airport the more attention I paid to the object‚Äôs flight pattern. After seeing how slowly it was moving I ruled out the possibility of it being an airplane, and thought it was a glider.  The only other logical possibilities were a hot-air balloon or a helicopter. When I clearly saw its oblong shape I ruled out these possibilities too. Curious, I pulled off the road onto the soft shoulder, came to a stop, and turned my engine off. I got out of the car and listened carefully for any audible sound. Nothing. Not a whir, not a click, not a sound! The windowless gray object wasn‚Äôt hovering. Instead it slowly drifted in a northwesterly direction across Herndon Avenue toward the airstrip about a hundred feet above my head, still continuing its descent. I felt sure it would land but instead it drifted west and began following Herndon Avenue back toward highway 99. I got back in my car, turned around, and followed its white light. As I picked up speed it picked up speed. The faster I accelerated the faster it went. Then in the blink of an eye it pulled away from me, its intense white taillight receding into the black starry night. What was that? I thought. The traffic on Herndon that night was non-existent. In 1974, Herndon Avenue was little more than a two-lane country road. I‚Äôm calling the airport when I get home. Maybe they‚Äôll have some information. Someone surely saw that. Once home I called the Fresno Air Terminal control tower directly, which you could do in the early 70s. ‚ÄúHas anything odd shown up on your radar screen the past thirty minutes?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo sir,‚Äù the air traffic controller answered. ‚ÄúWhy, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow could you have missed it?‚Äù ‚ÄúMissed what?‚Äù After explaining my encounter he said, ‚ÄúWell, for one thing it would depend on its altitude and location relative to our radar equipment,‚Äù and then continued with some additional mumbo-jumbo about how radar works. As I slowly calmed down from my excitement I explained to him in detail what I had seen. ‚ÄúYou know, that‚Äôs really odd. Someone else called me from near the Sanger River bottom earlier tonight relating almost exactly what you‚Äôve described.‚Äù And the following week I was northbound on highway 41 south of the San Joaquin River Bridge, when I noticed a bright-white light in the sky similar to the one I‚Äôd seen earlier. I felt sure it was an airplane and continued observing it as I crossed the bridge. As soon as the object reached Avenue 10 it took a laser-like ninety-degree turn to the left and accelerated out of sight at an unbelievable speed. Many people have experienced sightings of UFOs. Many scientists and the military downplay their existence because nine out of ten sightings can be explained by other phenomena. Some people claim they were abducted, with a small percentage of these asserting that medical experiments and who knows what else were performed on them. Since that time I have listened to stories and accounts of UFOs with interest on one hand, and with reservation on the other. Most of these sightings involve objects shaped like discs or triangularpatterned groups of objects. Nearly all first-hand accounts have not described what I saw‚Äîan oblong-shaped craft. With the advent of the Internet I have revisited the subject hoping to find photos or stories that more closely mirrored my experiences. My search uncovered only one sighting that described something similar to what I saw. This incident happened near Mansfield, Ohio, on October 18, 1973, and was widely recognized as one of the most notable UFO sightings that year. I was amazed to find how many similarities my encounters shared with this documented UFO sighting. Here are a few samples: ‚ÄúCigar-shaped metallic object with dome, body lights, light beam, apparent lifting force‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúhovering relationship‚Äù ‚ÄúThe object appeared solid‚Ä¶red light at the nose, a white light at the tail‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúNo turbulence was felt and‚Ä¶heard no sound‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶the object accelerated and moved off to the west, showing only the white ‚Äútail‚Äù light as it receded, and made a distinct 45 degree course change to the right, heading toward Lake Erie.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn the ground, the driver and passengers of a car saw two lights, one red and one green‚Ä¶ At first they thought it was a small plane flying low‚Ä¶heard no sound‚Ä¶its unusual qualities caused the driver to pull over and stop.‚Äù There is no doubt that what I saw was real. It was just out of my realm of understanding. I haven‚Äôt witnessed another sighting since, but will continue to search the skies for unusual events ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

     "text":"Cigar shaped craft hovering over a tree line approximately a hundred yards from me and seventy five feet off the ground. Clear sky with minimal clouds.  I live at the base of two mountains in a valley where this sighting occurred.  Against the blue sky I noticed what appeared to be a plane over the mountain west of my house.  I paid no further attention and went back inside my house.  Approximately two to three minutes later a sound that I cannot describe as I have never heard anything like it before became very loud to the point I had to cover my ears.  The air seemed like it was electrically charged and my body was suffering from the sound.  Almost like standing in front of a bass guitar amp played at loud volume.  The first thing that came to mind was that the plane I had seen was crashing.  I went to my front door, which has a storm door as well entirely made of glass.  The storm door was vibrating so strongly I thought it was going to shatter.   I ran outside afraid that the plane was going to crash into my house and that is when I noticed what can only be described as a cigar shaped UFO, only one end came to a point where the other was rounded like a cigar.  It was approximately seventy five feet off the ground hovering parallel with a stand of trees that runs adjacent to my drive way. These trees are very old and tall, the craft seemed to be able to push the tops of trees out of the way as it continued to move.  It should have definitely made contact with the top of several trees but I could see them being pushed out of the way as if by some invisible force.  The length of the craft was easily two hundred feet at a minimum.  It had the appearance of brushed aluminum.  Even in the broad day light it seemed to emit a yellow/gold light from underneath it.  I watched all of this over the course of several minutes until it drifted away out of sight. It then appeared instantaneously over a mountain approximately a half mile in the distance where it went over the crest and down the other side.  I know that I should have been able to see it ascend the mountain!  But after the trees had blocked my view and it was out of sight for approximately ten seconds when it appeared out of nowhere at the top of said mountain. The moment I came outside of my house the noise and \"vibrations\" stopped. The craft made absolutely no noise and the only sound I heard while watching it was the rustling of the leaves as the UFO moved over them. I live in a wooded area and it is the first time I have ever heard complete silence. No birds or insects made any noise and at this point almost three hours later it is still dead silent.  I could see no windows but there were two spots that almost seemed like they were made of mercury very fluid like. They appeared to ripple as the sun reflected off them.  I have no mental health problems and I am not on any medication.  My nose had started to bleed at some point when I was watching the ufo but I did not notice it until I went inside but by this time my white T-shirt had been covered in quite a bit of blood so it had to be bleeding for several minutes. I have had a terri! ble headache ever since the noises and vibrations. I know I'm jumping around a lot in my text, I'm still shaking from the event and my mind is racing. I know what I saw was not a hallucination or a misidentification.  I could feel the heat radiating from the UFO and had I walked a hundred yards I could have been underneath it.  That is how close it was.  I hope I never see anything like that again.  The whole event happened over five minutes.  However when I went back inside thirty to forty minutes had passed. I had been recording a TV show on DVR that had just come on at 1:30 pm. The program was an hour long and when I had went back inside my house the program was nearly done with maybe fifteen minutes left.",

     "text":"Very much like an ordinary star, except that it moved quickly and erratically in the vicinity of a stationary \"star\" I would like to say that I am 56 years of age, a USAF veteran, and a trained observer, being employed as an inspector for many years. I am very able to observe and report in extreme detail an accurate account of my observeration(s). I currently am still blessed with 20/20 vision in both eyes, but do need a 1.25 diopter lens set to read clearly.  When I observed this UFO, I was not under the influence of any vision altering drug, as I am sure Zegerid does not alter my vision and have not observed any problem whatsoever with my 'distant' vision. It was moderately snowing, and I was actually in Escadillia Bonita Acres, (spelling) in New Mexico, USA which is just East of the Arizona/New Mexico border and is located in New Mexico. It was dark, and getting colder when I went out to my truck to get my coffee mug. As I turned to return to the trailer where we were staying at night during our elk hunt, I glanced towards where we had Dad's elk hanging in a tree nearby. As I did, a light in the sky caught my eye. As I looked directly at it, I thought it to be nothing more than a clearing in the coulds, where a star was \"shining\" through. I thought that this was strange, due to the steady snowfall, but no \"big deal\". As I started to turn away, a movement in this \"star\" made me look again. I was amazed to see this \"star\" begin to move erratically at a rapid pace, looking very much like someone moving a laser pen light around on a darkened wall, except it was not red, it was white, much like a star. This light was due East towards Springerville, Arizona, USA, and at an approximate 40 degree rise from the surface of the earth. The thought immediately occured to me that I must be \"wobbling\" and I quickly leaned against the truck to stabilize my body and head and noted that there was another \"star\" just to the left of the one that was moving erratically, only this \"star\" was completely immobile. As soon as I realized that this observation was totally out of the ordinary, I yelled quite loudly \"Dad, get out here, there is a UFO out here!\" He came out immediately, and looked at it as I pointed at it. It was stationary from that point on, and slowly faded away as if the clouds obscured it. The other \"star\" remained visable, and we watched for a few minutes as it too faded from view, which I attribute to the clouds and snow. In our observation, I was the only one to! see the quick and erratic motion of this light/star like object in the sky. I am quite familiar with aircraft, and this was completely quiet and moved way to fast and strangely for me to think that it was ours unless we have some craft that is not a part of the general public knowlege. It was quite cold, and snowing, so we retired to the warmth of the trailer.",

My wife and I were driving northbound on I-25 from Colorado Springs to Denver.  The sighting happened somewhere between CO 470 and Yale Avenue.  We had seen several commercial aircraft flying at low altitudes over the interstate coming from DIA before the sighting.  We then saw two flat, white discs or cigar shaped objects.  We were looking at them edge on, they were definitely not saucer or dome shaped.  The objects were moving at approximately the same altitude and speed relative to the other commercial airliners. The two objects caught our attention because they seemed to move similar to the aircraft previously seen, but didn't have wings and appeared at least twice the size of the commercial airliners.  In comparison with the Sun, they would have fit almost perfectly into the radius of the Sun's circle, with perhaps some overlap for the object closest to us (further south).  They looked like thin, bring white lines across the deep blue sky.  Today was a beautiful sunny day, so their bright white color against the deep blue back drop was very easily seen. I estimated they were a good 5 to 10 miles ahead of us, looking due North.  Of course, I'm not a good judge of aerial distances, but I use the other commercial aircraft in the area as my point of reference for this estimation.  One of the objects was obviously closer to us (further south) while the second appeared smaller and seemed to be few miles further North than the first object closest to us.   They appeared to move from an E to a NW direction, similar to the commercial aircraft coming out of DIA over downtown Denver headed west over the mountains.  Then, they suddenly stopped over I-25 or perhaps just west of I-25.   At this point we were looking at them NNW of our viewpoint on I-25N.  The two objects then hovered for about 30 seconds max (possibly less) and then began to turn a reddish orange color, slowly becoming more and more transparent with the blue sky - and then poof!  They disappeared!   This all happened in less than a minute and we were traveling at 80 mph.  So unfortunately, we didn't get a photo or video of the event.  However, it did shake up my wife and was very unsettling to her.  She has not been one to believe in UFO's and when I tried to talk to her about it afterward, she was very uncomfortable and didn't want to discuss it.  I know what I saw and this was something very \"unidentifiable.\"   If anyone else on I-25 at this same time headed northbound along side us looked up in the sky to the North-Northwest, they would have seen the same thing.  I would imagine anyone in those commercial aircraft headed west out of DIA would have also seen this.",

The object was a dull silver, with light from the sun reflecting off of it.

With both the USAF and with the Federal Aviation Admin.  I grew up around Loring AFB and the Presque Isle airport (along with many nav sights in northern Maine).  My point here is these lights were between me and the Bangor VOR, which sits a few miles off the north end of Bangor International Airport. There were no strobe or anti collision  lights, no wing position lights, a red light should have been visible as they were approaching me and the left wing would have a red light marking it.   As i said earlier, there was no sound at any time.  The lights were about 2 to 3 football fields apart from the time the appeared until they moved out of my sight.  I see aircraft flying over and around home most every day.  BIA is the home of the 101st air refueling wing, flying KC 135 Stratotankers, which make a huge noise on take off and cruising overhead.   Also we have a helicopter unit stationed here, flying UH 60 Blackhawks, which are also noisy.  The lights approached no closer than  2 football fields near me.  I saw no other lights or aircraft in the sky.",

((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the source of the report to submit separate reports, so that they sort by the date of occurrence.  PD)) Hi!  My name is ((name deleted)).  I Prefer people know my first name.  My UFO encounter consists not of one but 5 different encounters which I believe to be of the same or similar type craft.  I would like to share my story if I would be allowed. My first encounter was when I was 4 years old in Lake Stevens, Washington, in the year 1993. I do not remember the encounter but my mom does.  She, myself, my brother and grandma all witnessed a UFO that night around 10:00 pm at our house.  I was in the living room.  My mom said she looked out of the kitchen window because she noticed a bright light and she said it looked like two car headlights coming towards her, except in the sky above the treeline.  All of a sudden the house filled with blinding white light which lasted for a few seconds.  The power to the house flickered just before the light came.  She stepped onto the porch and she said she saw 1 bright ball of light roughly 200-250 feet in the air above our house.  According to her the size of the craft was at least 3 times the size of our house. It hovered motionless for about 10 seconds before taking off in the blink of an eye in a zigzag pattern.  North to south over the treeline.  It took but a second before it was gone.  The UFO did not make a sound at all. I feel I must add that I had nightmares of 4-5 foot grey beings with big almond shaped eyes when I was around 3 or 4 years old doing things to me like operating or performing surgery on me. Long before I even knew what aliens were or what they looked like. My second encounter that I had I was living in the same house and I was 6 years old. Around the same time as last time if my memory is correct, the house again filled with a brilliant blinding light which lasted  about 5 seconds.  I remember the light did not hurt my eyes but made visibility very bad.  I could however see my window next to my front door just fine and I ran towards the window to see what was up there and I saw a bright white oval or egg shaped craft just above my house at again around 200 feet in the air.  I would say the craft was at least twice the size of our house.  I wouldn't say the UFO was massive but was quite large in size.  I stepped onto my porch only to see it take off in a zigzag pattern at thousands of miles an hour or so it seemed. It was gone in the blink of an eye. A small detail I can add to that is that it seemed like it disappeared and reappeared about a 100 feet away every time and stopped for just a moment before taking off again. The event! occurred over the span of roughly 35-40 seconds.  Again, the event was soon followed by strange dreams of grey beings however being so young I didn't understand that they were not normal dreams. Still to this day I can remember every dream I had of those beings like it was yesterday.  They may be just dreams.  That's all I can say about them but strange quin-cadences nonetheless. My third encounter I will briefly explain because it is almost exactly the same as the previous two. I was living in the same house.  I was 7 years old in 1996. my house filled with light which lasted a few moments.  I stepped onto the porch immediately already knowing what it was.  I however did notice that the craft wasn't as bright as before and I noticed it was made out of a shiny, reflective metal.  It took off in a zigzag again and it was gone.  The power also flickered again just before the light struck like the previous two times and the UFO did not make a peep.  Me, my mom and grandma all saw it. The fourth encounter was again in lake Stevens. I was 11 or 12. I can't remember however It was not at my house.  I was in the back seat of my moms Volvo. We were traveling on a trestle going from the city of Everett to Lake Stevens, Washington.  It's basically a long free way bridge.  We were near the end of the trestle coming to a large hill going into lake Stevens.  I Noticed to our left a large glowing ball of light traveling slowly towards us.  When I noticed it it was about 500 feet or more out and about 300-400 feet off the ground or more. All of a sudden it was upon us. Just a 100 feet or less above our car. It was matching our speed which was 50 miles an hour. It followed us for only a few seconds before it hit our car with a bright beam of light which filled our car with light but did not blind my mom who was driving. It did not hit any other cars near us with this light. At least not that I can remember.  My mom said WOW!, LOOK AT THAT DREW!. She actually pulled over. S! he asked me to grab the camera out of the back seat of the car but I struggled to get the case open for just a few moments before the craft which was still hovering over us distracted my attention and gave up and gave her the case. She never got the case open in time.  The craft actually started descending on us slowly as we were parked.  The craft hovered over our car for about 10 seconds before taking off to the right of us in a mind-boggling speed in a zig-zag pattern.  It traveled in that direction for about 2 seconds and got almost a mile away from us before shooting straight up into space.  It again didn't make a sound.  People had also parked on the side of the trestle next to us.  I didn't notice if anyone was  videotaping it but I remember my mom said for a moment she thought the craft was gonna land on us it got so close and one of the other onlookers had mentioned the same thing. The craft was egg-shaped except was a little more elongated than an egg. It was clearly ma! de out of a very reflective metal and when the craft was hover! ing abov e us the light seemed to dim but I could tell that the light was emanating from inside the craft. We could have probably fit 10  Volvo's in the craft and still had room to spare. I did not have any strange dreams before or after that event. My 5th encounter is the most profound thing that has ever happened to me, even still to this day. I was living in Oregon at the time. I was 15 years of age. I was living with my mom, brother and sister and my moms boyfriend at the time. The house resided on a large steep hill about 15 minutes out of town. The driveway up the hill took about 3 minutes to drive up. The house was primarily surrounded by thick forest. It was around 2:00 A.M. I was sitting on my couch in my living room playing halo 2 on my x box 360 alone. My mom was in her room on her PC and her boyfriend was up late working downstairs in the basement. All of a sudden my x box and TV shut off. The power remained going to the rest of my house. It was just my x box and TV that shut off. For a moment I was confused and angry but for just a moment because immediately after that I noticed a bright light through my window to my left just above my couch. I then peeled the curtain back and saw a bright ball of light just outside my window. It didn't immediately click in my head what it was but just a moment after I peeled the curtain back the house filled with a brilliant white light. The light this time was so bright that I could not see my hands when I held them in front of my face. The light lasted for about 15 seconds. As soon as I saw the craft I screamed out‚ÄùMOM THE UFO IS BACK‚Äù and started running to her room and then the light hit the house. I froze. I could not see anything but light. I yelled out‚ÄùMOM,The house is filled with light! ‚ÄúCan u see‚Äù I asked and she said no. I then realized that the windows were still visible! . Everything in the house was white except my windows. So I walked towards the window and as soon as I got to the window and peeked through it the light stopped, so I stepped out onto my back patio. What I then saw after that I will never forget. What I saw was a glowing metal craft. It was again the same shape as before. Light was strobing through the craft in all colors of the spectrum. Like what oil would look like with sunlight reflecting off of it. It appeared almost as if the light was some sort of force-field around it. The craft remained metal in appearance however the light pulsing through it was also notable. The craft was easily 3 times the size of our house or at least it appeared to be fairly large.  About half the length of a football field or so. It just hovered there above our back patio for about 20 or so seconds. My moms boyfriend had stepped out onto the patio with us for a moment before he ran back inside to get the camera. My mom had turned her head for just a moment to yell out‚Äù hurry up or your going to miss out‚Äù. During that time I my eyes remained fixed on the object. As the craft hovered there, I witnessed a window open up. A part of the craft had become completely transparent. The ‚Äúwindow‚Äù quickly moved from the right side of the craft to the left before the window went away and the craft became solid again. What I saw during that short period of time, or what I thought I saw were a dozen or more white or grey skinned beings with arms all held out like they were holding hands and were all looking right at us. The craft then flew up 50 or so feet slowly and then took off at light speed and I'll explain why I use the term ‚Äúlight speed‚Äù. The craft traveled in a zig zag pattern like before. Except this time when it moved, it left images of itself behind following all the way back to its original position. I'll try my best to explain this. The craft would disappear and then immediately reappear a few hundred or so feet away leaving behind hundreds of translucent mirror images of itself. and when it reappeared the craft would then catch up with itself. Like the main bad guy from the movie,chronicles of riddick. How the guy could seemingly jump out of his body,travel a little ways and then his body would then catch up with his ...soul or whatever. My apologies for the bad analogy but I find it very hard to describe what I saw. I've never seen anything like it in my life nor have I heard of anything like that before.  What I saw that craft do didn't just defy physics, it defied reality.! The craft seemed to move almost as if the light couldn't keep up with it. In my opinion anyways. My moms boyfriend made it out with the camera but by time he got the camera turned on the craft was already gone. The light the UFO emitted into the house filled every room in our 3 story house. The door to my moms room was closed and her window drapes were down and yet her room became filled with the light too. My moms boyfriend that was working in the basement at the time had no possible means of light to get in there. Basement stairs were shut, there were no windows and the only light that should have been in the basement should have been from his lamp however the basement too became filled with this bright light. Don't ask me how but that's what he said to me. Also another detail to add to this strange event is my x box. I was playing my game before this event took place and my TV and x box shut off on me. Well, when I got back into the living room I noticed my box and TV were on and not only that but my progress had remained in the game. I even died and re-spawned somehow during the x box being‚Äù turned off‚Äù. I find it funny though because in halo, you play as a space marine guy who kills aliens.  Maybe it wasn't a game they found amusing.  I don't know.   Before I end this story I must add that a few weeks after that event I had a very weird dream. Several actually but one  in particular  worth noting(in my opinion). In my dream I woke up and walked into my living room. My living room was pitch black however a bright light was shining through the windows behind me. And in the corner of my living room the light had shined on something. I stepped a little closer to see what it was and it moved slowly into the light. It was a 4 to ! 5 foot being with a elongated skull and big almond-shaped eyes. It was wearing a silver or metallic-looking suit that was skin tight. It had one blue stripe running down its right arm and a white line around its waist almost like a belt or a seal you would see on a spacesuit except thin like a string. It also had a blue patch on the middle of its chest with a weird symbol on it. I distinctly remember having an overwhelming feeling rush over me. The emotion was love. I felt like a heart-warming sensation come over me and I suddenly got the feeling like this being was very happy or it was very happy to see me. No fear came over me. Just an overwhelming feeling that I remember to this day. It also felt like this being was very fond of me. It just looked at me for a few moments and then I don't remember the rest of the dream and I woke up with my pants soaked. Not sure why. Maybe I sweat in my sleep. I don't know. I'm not claiming I was abducted by aliens. I'm just noting strange quin-cadences. I have researched UFO's and witness testimony's and anything UFO related honestly and I have yet to hear of any case quite like mine. I'm posting this to you all in hopes that someone else will read this and post they're story like mine. Perhaps I'm not the only one with these specific kinds of experiences. I know I'm supposed to only submit one UFO sighting at a time but I didn't have a sighting to report, I had a story to tell. my apologies for the lack of visual evidence. I carry my camera on me at all times at the ready now, just in case.",

At approximately 8:28pm, I stepped outside to lock up a conference trailer on my company‚Äôs property. After I locked up the trailer and began to walk away, I glanced up towards the moon, almost directly overhead, and I was surprised to see what appeared to be four red lights crossing the sky at a slow but steady pace. I stopped and stared upwards at the lights. They seemed to be traveling from north to south in a straight line. I couldn‚Äôt see what the lights were attached to. I couldn‚Äôt see the shape of any kind of aircraft. I couldn‚Äôt tell how high or how low they were in the sky, however if it was one solid object and it was very high, then that would meen it was very big as well. The lights easily stretched out to cover the sky about ten moons wide. They were also very quiet. If they made any sound, it could have been the sound of a commercial airliner passing at a very high altitude overhead, a very faint and distant sound, although that sound could have easily been confused with the low hum of A/C units on top of a nearby office building as well. I'm not sure the object(s) made any sound at all. The lights did not blink, nor were they were not very bright. They were almost faint in the sky, easy to miss unless you glance up and happened to spot it. They did not have the normal navigation lights you expect to see on any commercial aircraft. There were no strobe lights, no green lights to show what side of the aircraft you might be viewing. They did seem to be traveling to my left, but keep in mind they were practically overhead too. I still should have seen a green light next to each red light if these were planes in formation. It is possible that these were military fighter jets with an different light configuration than what civilians are used to seeing, but these seemed to move slower than I would have expected to see and I actually am used to seeing fighter jets at night. I was in the Navy and lived near Mira Mar in San Diego. I‚Äôm used to hearing the jets clear! ly and s eeing a blue light with a white strobe. At least, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to seeing over the city at night. As I continued to watch the lights, a few moments into observing all this, I realized I might be witnessing a UFO sighting and so I quickly tried to gather any more information I could before the lights flew out of sight. I was too far from my truck to grab my camera. None of the security cameras pointed straight up. I realized my eyes would be the only thing I could rely on to remember this by. My first thought was to look at each light closely. What each light seemed to be was a set of three lights. There were two bright red lights with a white light in the middle. That white light seemed to be dimmer than the red lights by comparison, but also seemed to be on the leading edge of each set. The next thing I tried to determine before it got too far was if what I was seeing was a formation of aircraft or one solid object. I jogged back a few steps until a bright enough star was in it‚Äôs path. I stopped when the upper two sets of lights seemed to be getting close to that star. Halfway between the two sets of lights, the star disappeared for a moment. It seemed to me at that point that what I was seeing was one solid chevron shaped object. The whole sighting took maybe 15 to 20 seconds before the lights went over the horizon and behind the building I was standing near. I ran to the far edge of the building to get a few more seconds of viewing, but the lights were too far gone by that point. I could not see any more. I asked around, but I was the only person who saw this. I reported this to the Carlsbad Police Department and to Channel 6 News in San Diego. I will include an image I drew of the sighting. I am 29 years old, Ex-Navy, a trained observer, and I‚Äôve worked at that location, near Palomar Airport, for at least 4 years. I have never seen lights like this, not here or anywhere else for that matter. I'd also like to note that cloud cover moved in later that night and the direction of the wind seemed t! o go aga inst the direction these lights were traveling.",

     "text":"UFO Sighting Over Homestead, FL. I got up at 3:45 a.m. because I had to use the bathroom. After using the restroom, I came back to my room and laid down.  I had my bedroom window open.  I got on FB via my cell and was checking my status at this time.  Then I laid back down, and I couldn't fall asleep so I began looking out the window from my bed. This is when I saw a fireball drop from the sky, I immediately went to the window, to see where this object came from and saw, a silhouette of some type of plane gliding silently in the sky.  I could not make out what it was as there were no lights on this object. The fireball was falling, as it fell it split into about seven smaller fireballs.  They look white with a tail, actually they look like falling stars or rather balls of fire.  I thought it was a bomb and that we were under some terrorist attack. I was facing East, towards my parents home.  Actually, the white balls of fire, never touched the ground but, just stayed floating then they disappeared. I tried to wake up my roommate as I was afraid.  Then, I could not sleep, I was worried as my friend wouldn't wake so I stayed in bed looking out the window.  I didn't close it. I observed a small plane circling the area of where this occurred for about fifteen minutes and then it left.  Then, it was almost morning, around 4:30 to 5:00 a.m.  Now it is almost daylight.  Again, this object, came back to the same spot and dropped another fireball down.  I can only tell you that even though it was almost daylight, I could not see clearly the object that dropped this fireball, but only that you could faintly make out that it was some sort of craft, but invisible, no color, no lights and you can see it gliding away right when the fireball drops from it.  Again, this ball of light split into approximately five or six smaller balls of light, they were white.  I can say, I thought it was a comet, or what looks like a comet as when it moved or rather glided it had a tail emitting from the opposite direction. But then I saw these balls of light flying around, and then disappeared for a second time.  Shortly after, now panicked I kept calling my mom, and she was up.  She said that, the only thing she has noticed for the past three days at this hour, including the day of my sighting, was that her house, kept losing power that it felt like something had been draining the power from her home and her lights kept coming off and on and her battery back up would come on.  The lights though would dim she said as if it was being drained. There are several You Tubes that were captured and you can see clearly that they are in the direction of where I stated.  Almost above my parent's home, but high in the sky.",

     "text":"I can describe it, but I still don't know what it was:  alien probe, military, possible living organism. Encounter on a Lonely Desert Road By ((name deleted))   The beams of my headlights seemed to be chasing elusive shadows cast against the desert sage as I drove through the dark moonless night towards Congress, Arizona.  Retired now, a gold prospector with the time to fulfill my quest for the big nugget, my thoughts then were of gold and only gold‚Ä¶that was about to change.  Just about midnight and just South of the middle of nowhere, I had stopped and pulled off the road to relieve myself and take a break from driving, and it was at this moment that I first saw what I thought to be a helicopter with a bright searchlight circling the area southwest of me.  Having served with the U.S.A.F., I have seen many types of aircraft, but this was something I had never seen before. It was a red light intermittently beaming a brilliant, focused white light down to the ground as if to be looking for someone or something, and I thought what or who would be way out there, and why there were no strobe I.D. lights on the helicopter.  I didn‚Äôt ! give it much more thought and got back in the car and grabbed a cigarette, lit up and gazed back towards the southwest. The chopper was now circling closer to me and although my window was down, there was no noise‚Ä¶and I thought that was really strange.  Suddenly, what I thought was a helicopter flying at 500 feet was much smaller and much closer; in fact, it was now just on the other side of the road and was about 10 feet off the ground, hovering. I flicked the cigarette out the window.  I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. Am I hallucinating? ‚ÄúWhat the ____ is that?‚Äù My heart beating fast and my mind spinning, I watched as the object as it moved through the sparse vegetation, stopping now and then to illuminate the ground beneath with its powerful beam of white light, and then it appeared to morph into two tiny red lights, like twin LED‚Äôs (light emitting diodes) and started to cross the road towards me.  Now as it approached my car, it suddenly morphed back into its former shape:  a spherical orb about the size of a softball, bright red (DOT emergency red, like a tail-light).  Was this military?  Is this a living organism? Perhaps an alien probe?  It was now six feet in front of my car, four feet off the ground, just hovering. What the ____is this thing???  Somehow, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs military‚Ä¶no stars, insignia or guns‚Ä¶(chuckle) I noticed that although the red light emitted from this thing was very bright to my eyes, it wasn‚Äôt casting shadows and did not reflect from the surrounding bushes or from the polished surface of my hood.  I could see the surface of this thing seemed to be fluid-   like, and composed of what appeared to be millions of tiny dots of light swirling around very fast and was very hard for my eyes to focus on it.  The perimeter seemed to fuzz out at the edges, like an aura or halo.  The light seemed to be luminous rather than projected, and was not radiating any heat that I could feel. It‚Äôs amazing what goes through your head when confronted with an un-known like this‚Ä¶ a memory of Dr. XXXXXXXX of  S.E.T.I. explaining that most UFO sightings are mostly swamp gas or weather balloons‚Ä¶Hey Doc!  Here‚Äôs one that will fit right up your telescope! At this moment, I was toying with the idea of getting out of my car to approach the orb and try to communicate with it. Suddenly, the orb started to move a little closer to me, and my curiosity was overcome by fear‚Ä¶ I felt panic consume me and simultaneously engaged the engine and hit the lights.  The orb reacted by backing away slightly.  Illuminated by my headlights, I could plainly see that there were no mechanical parts or structure. I slammed the gearshift into drive, and floored it.  I wanted to put as much distance between that thing and me as fast as possible.  I warily glanced in the rear-view mirror and was horrified to realize that it was pursuing me down the road at 90 mph. I grabbed my cell phone and hurriedly called 911.  NO SERVICE.  I started laughing out loud.  Who the hell would believe me if I reported being chased by a hovering, glowing red softball?  They would think I was drunk or stoned out of mind! The little town of Congress had already rolled up the sidewalks and turned off the lights, and not a soul stirring‚Ä¶well, it was 1:00 a.m. Arizona time.  I decided to park in a vacant lot near the Fire Station right off the main highway. For the next two or three hours, I watched odd lights moving through the dark moonless night.  I found that my eyesight had been affected by looking at the orb, and I could not focus on any bright light source. Whatever I tried looking at seemed to move away into periphery. Needless to say, I stayed parked there and tried my best to go to sleep and forget about what I had seen. Later, when I arrived home in California a couple of days later, I also noticed that my eyesight had not only been temporarily affected, but it had improved to some extent, and now can read small print without the use of my reading glasses. I have shared this story with a few friends, but I notice that their eyes glaze over and I realize that they don‚Äôt believe what I saw.  If someone told me this story, I don‚Äôt think that I would believe it myself.  All said, I swear that this report is absolutely true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

The objects we (several witnesses, several times) saw near Dillon, Montana, in 1963 were also single bright white lights, but they could make right angle turns without slowing and stopped on a dime also.",

I received a call from a friend to look at some weird lights in the sky.  He described them as red and blue lights moving back and forth like a kite (they saw it from 10-10:13pm prior to calling me @ 10:13). At approximately 10:13pm on May 19, 2010 I looked out the back window of my house and saw four red lights lined up horizontally, they were stationary at this point.  They had an LED look to them, very bright and focused points of light, not beams.  I immediately told the two friends I had at my house with me to come outside and see it.  When we came out it was gone, but there were many helicopters in the air circling (at least three).  Then the four red lights came back into view as they quickly moved straight upwards from behind the buildings directly to my West until they were approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, at this moment the object transformed instantly from four red lights into one slightly larger blue light and headed in the exact oppos! ite direction straight down.  The change in color, direction and number of objects seen happened simultaneously and it appeared to move sharply with no acceleration or deceleration and did not seems to make any noise.  The four red lights from end to end were approximately two to three times as wide as the moon was from my vantage point and the blue light was about a third as wide as the moon.  I was located at Nutmeg Avenue and Lexington Street in Sarasota, FL facing between W and WNW.  My friends who called me were standing at Superior Avenue and Gulf Gate Drive in Sarasota facing directly North, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon from their point of view.  The helicopters that were in the sky circled this area for about twenty to thirty minutes after we last saw the lights.  Afterwards, I called every news station in town and they all confirmed that they either did not own a helicopter or it was grounded at the time.  I also contacted the County Sheriff‚Äôs Departme! nt and they confirmed that they did not have their helicopter ! in the a ir.  I called everyone again the next day (5/20/10) and asked if they would confirm that they had no helicopters in the air at that time.  They all confirmed.  Next I called Air Traffic Control at the Sarasota International Airport, they said that they knew of nothing, but gave me the FAA Flight Standards contact information.  After asking about the helicopters, I explained my story to them.  About an hour later I received a call back from the FAA, the gentleman I spoke with was very friendly and helpful but could not give me any answers.  He suggested I contact NUFORC at that point.  That leaves me with two lingering questions: 1) What did we see? 2) Whose helicopters were in the air, why were they there and what do they know about the events we witnessed?",

     "text":"UFO above my house. Possibly abducted. Sometime in the middle of October 2010, I was up late playing computer games in my bedroom on the second story of my home here in Harleysville Pennsylvania. I was getting tired around 12:30am and decided to go to sleep around 1:00am. I fell asleep quite quickly in nothing but my boxers.  Before I go into detail about the encounter I experienced, allow me to explain the layout of my room relative to the map I submitted. My bedroom is on the second story on the southwest end of my home. I have 3 windows in my room on the front face of the house and have access to both the attic and the only fire escape on the building. This house used to be an old office building in which my bedroom was one of the offices used. My actual bed is located in the southwest corner next to a window and directly next to the fire escape door. This door has no handle on the outside and only a bar-release on the inside similar to what you would find on the inside of a school entrance door or office building. The door also has a 1.3x1.3 foot window in the top center. The actual fire escape on the outside of the door is nothing more than a metal platform and railing leading down the side of my house with metal stairs. I often use this to have a cigarette when I am at home since smoking inside the house is forbidden by the landlord. This goes to say I am quite familiar with what the scenery on the outside of my home ! looks like in this location. I awoke on this day around 3am based on the dark of night outside, however, when I awoke I was already outside on my fire escape platform. I had not been dreaming as far as I could tell since everything was as it was when I am awake, and have had many vivid almost lucid dreams in the past, and I can tell you this was not that sensation. I was very groggy and confused as to how I had walked in my sleep. I have not sleepwalked since I was about 8 years old, and at this time I was 19 almost 20. I almost immediately noticed something very very large above me after this initial confusion, and took quick notice to my door being closed behind me leaving no way of re-entering my home. As soon as I noticed this however, I felt the urge to look at this large object hovering above me. As I looked up I noticed it was sort of rounded in shape but had many many lights on the underside of it. It was directly above me so I had no view of the sides of the object.  The lights were a very very bright white.  Nothing like any fluorescent bulb I have ever seen. These lights were flashing without any pattern it seemed and were located all over the underside of the object in rectangular and very long trapezoidal shapes.  The object had to have been at least 250 feet in diameter, possibly larger. The underside of the object also had many things jutting out from it with these lights on it as well, but I took a firm notice to one in particular.  There was this large piece with the lights on the side of it coming out from the right of the object. It's shape was like an upside down cone with the end cut off. It resembled an air filter for a high performance engine in a car.  It had symmetrical lights all around its sides that were identical to the ones on the underside of the object, however the bottom of this piece jutting out was a very very dark gray-black color. When I had first looked up, the lights were so blinding that I had to shield my eyes with one hand to see they were flashing and their shapes and locations. I observed all of this within less than 90 seconds before I became very disoriented. I forgot what I was doing, where I was at, and who I was. Almost as if these lights were inducing an acute case of amnesia. The last thing I can remember before passing out was the strange sensation of floating. I had never experienced this before, but it was as if I were suddenly weightless. My feet were no longer touching the cold metal platform and I was no longer shielding my eyes. As soon as I was blinded by the lights that were flashing I seemed to lose consciousness, unless the lights caused me to forget everything leaving me no memory of anything afterwards. Throughout these short minutes the object made absolutely no sound. It was as if it was making everything around it completely quiet. If you have ever heard the saying \"Silence is Deafening,\" I would have to agree, there were no sounds made after I noticed the object above me. This was extremely strange since my home is on a main road, and relatively close to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Hearing not even the sound of a cricket chirp or the hum of the highway was definitely weird. I also remember the silence being almost suffocating. It felt very heavy, as if it were making the air thick like soup. In my short, and very close observation, I remember the object being about 20 to 40 feet above me and the space in between my house and the neighbors house, and the tree in between the front of our homes was blocking out a portion of this large object. There was no wind, as if Time had stopped in its tracks. This is all simply speculation, but it was what it seemed to me. After I lost consciousness, it got extremely bizarre. I remember waking up without any senses except for my sight and sense of balance. I was laying down with my eyes looking upwards towards what seemed to be a ceiling. My eyes were not working correctly though. It was as if I had been administered eye drops that you would get at the doctors to dilate your pupils. Everything was very blurry and distorted. I remember very little, but I do remember everything was a green/brown/gray color around me. I also remember seeing strange objects above me that appeared to be tools or examination equipment above me, none of which seemed to be created by humans. It was very very blurry though so it was hard to tell if that was exactly what it was. I then remember a figure move into view above me. I was unable to move at all, and my vision was very poor so I could discern nothing about this being other than it seemed a little taller than I am and it had appendages like a human being (arms, torso, head, legs, etc.). It did not speak to me, however, I seemed to hear a voice in my head. It was much less a voice than it was a feeling or emotion being conveyed. The very last thing I can remember was feeling very calm, as if this being was trying to help me in some sort of way. The \"trying to help you\" feeling I received was much less about me in particular, but more of a \"you\" as in \"your race.\" I then saw one of the objects above me move slightly, and I lost consciousness again. When I came to I was sitting on the edge of my bed. My bed was made very neatly as if I had never layed down at all that night. When i looked at my alarm clock, the time was about 4:45am. I tried to remember how I got there, but nothing came to mind. I tried to sleep, but my thoughts were buzzing faster than I could even keep up with. I could not sleep no matter how hard I tried that night. The only thing I kept asking myself was \"Why wasn't I scared or afraid throughout this entire experience?\"   I am not trying to garner attention in any way shape or form with this.. This is why I am choosing to remain anonymous. I just hope that maybe this can help somebody understand things a little better, even if I can not understand any of this myself. I always thought the UFO phenomenon was a bunch of crap before this experience. Since this experience I have been haunted, and have wanted to tell somebody but have always been too afraid of being called a crackpot. The only person I have ever told this story to is my best friend, and he is probably the only person who will ever know who I am and what I witnessed. I have witnessed a few other strange occurrences that happened after this account I have just given you, but they are far less important I think..  I hope this will help in some way shape or form. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

Also visible were commercial jetliners in the sky in the same general area of the sky.  This was neither a fireball or space junk - they don't slow down and come to a complete stop in the sk! y as this object did.  It was not the Moon, which was up and in a different part of the sky. It was not Jupiter, which was up and in a different part of the sky.  It was not Mars, which was up and in a different part of the sky.  It was not a satellite.  It was not the ISS.   I'm hoping that others observed this object and will make reports.",

     "text":"UFO Sightings in New York State similar to those reported on the June 20, 2012 Coast to Coast AM show. UFO  Report to NUFORC    I have experienced three UFO sightings, one with my daughter, one alone and most recently with my daughter‚Äôs boyfriend.   I had no intention of reporting my experiences until I received the Coast to Coast AM e-mail update on the June 20, 2012 show dealing with red-orange-yellow spherical UFO‚Äôs.   This is exactly the type of UFO I experienced all three times and the C2C show inspired me to report my experiences to NUFORC.  I did not have any way or chance to video any of these sightings.  The first sighting was my very first experience and it happened approximately 11:15 pm about 10 miles north of Syracuse , NY on August 30, 2011.  I pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car and watched the object approximately 10 minutes until it ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù instantly.  It was moving very slowly overhead at maybe 2000 feet from NW to NE moving maybe a quarter of a mile along a straight path at constant altitude. There was no sound at all.  It appeared to be ‚Äúpulsing‚Äù from red-orange and some yellow, kind of like a ‚Äúglowing‚Äù ball almost like ‚Äúfire‚Äù.  It was hard to estimate the size of the object  but it was larger than the lights of a landing aircraft or helicopter and much larger than when Venus was very visible this spring. (2012)   I KNOW it was NOT an aircraft, planet, balloon, flare, parachute or star.  I wonder if it could have been a secret military drone.  The following two sightings were essentially ‚Äúidentical‚Äù to the first in the appearance and characteristics of the objects.  The second sighting occurred on June 14, 2012 at approximately 8:45pm in  Oswego, NY.    The object moved in a straight line NW to N. I observed it for about one minute and it moved out of site...it did not disappear. The last sighting was June 16, 2012 about 10:15 pm also in Oswego, NY.  It moved in a straight path S to N over the roof of my house I estimate at 2000 feet.  No sound and VERY slow and we observed it for about 5 minutes when it ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù instantly. I KNOW it was not an aircraft, balloon or satellite . There was one difference in this object over the first two. I wear glasses and the object was so bright that it seemed to cause ‚Äú radiant spikes‚Äù from the general spherical shape. I took my glasses off and these ‚Äúspikes‚Äù disappeared and I was able to make out a king of pulsing between the spherical shape to a kind of cubical-elongated shape. This made me think of a military drone of some kind.   I have no idea what my 3 UFO‚Äôs were other than ‚Äúunidentified.‚Äù",

     "text":"1st night saw rectangle rimmed with lights, gliding, then next night, along same path, saw 4 orbs, rotating, creating geometric shapes. It was 3/96, during the time that Comet Hyakutake was visible, so I was looking up trying to see the comet, from the parking lot of my apt complex.  It was around the time of the new moon, so stars were prevalent.  What caught my eye was what looked like stars ‚Äúmoving‚Äù.  It was in fact, the outline of a large rectangle, moving across the sky. It had lights around the rim, so what I was seeing, was the moving lights against the stars, rimming what looked like a perfect rectangle.  I followed it gliding in a straight line, not sure what direction it was, until trees blocked it, maybe 30 seconds to a minute.  It was not very high, in the sky, maybe the height of a 20-story building (I grew up in NYC). The next night, feeling freaked out by what I had seen, I had my roommate come outside with me, to ‚Äúsee the comet‚Äù, but I needed to face my fear.  It was about 11pm, about an hour or so later than the sighting of the night before.  Along the same stretch of sky, almost the same ‚Äúpath‚Äù as the rectangle, we saw 4 orbs, perfectly round, bright lights, descending slowly from pretty high up, maybe 20 to 30 stories up, higher than the rectangle from previous night.  As they descended, they were forming geometric shapes & rotating.  They‚Äôd form a circle, square & an elliptical, all while rotating slowly.  Against logic, I moved under them, watching them form the shapes & rotate.  They descended very low, maybe 15 stories, give or take; I grew up in a 17-story building, it looked like they descended lower than the height of the top floor of that building, directly above my head & still rotating & forming shapes.  Directly beneath them, I could see the space between them, they did no! t look attached at all, but definitely more like 4 entirely separate orbs. After, what I‚Äôve since described as their ‚Äúshowboating‚Äù, because that‚Äôs really what it felt like, making geometric shapes, slowly, in the sky over my head, about 3 or 4 minutes, they started to move, almost exactly along the same path as the rectangle the night before, still forming shapes (mostly squares & circles at this point) & still revolving around eachother, but each together gliding along that same path, until out of site, by the same trees, moving a little slower than the rectangle the night before.  They were definitely not as high up as the rectangular object.  But both nights, there was absolutely no sound from either one, complete silence.  They were both low enough, that had they been an aircraft of some kind, we should definitely have heard something. At first my roommate corroborated my sighting completely, there were no other witnesses the first night.  However, we were both quite spooked by what we saw & although she described the same thing I saw, for several months, she eventually started to say it ‚Äúnever happened‚Äù or that it was ‚Äúexplainable‚Äù.  She never did give another explanation though, she just didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. We haven‚Äôt spoken in many years, I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôd be willing to talk about it now.",

     "text":"Saw a phasing orange/blue circular light , later saw a similar light at a different location in the sky My friend and I had plans to go out and use his old telescope to check out the full moon and stars.  After he picked me up, we drove to a spot in west Davis, off of a road surrounded by empty fields, somewhere to get away from the city lights.  We really were not that far out, maybe half a mile to a mile from decently lighted areas, but it was the best we could find on the spot.  We arrived at the scene, just off of a two way road at about 10:30 PM.  After spending about 10-15 minutes setting up the telescope, we quickly were able to find and focus in on the moon.  The view was very clean and clear, filling most of the viewfinder. After enjoying the moon for a few minutes, we decided to search for stars.  We turned the telescope the other way, facing north-west.  As my friend tried to focus in on a star at about 10:50 or earlier, I noticed a orange-blue/green light that seemed to be phasing from colored to not visible, or in and out of light, about every 1-2 seconds.  It was brighter than a star, and seemed to be at airplane altitude.  I could not tell how far away it was.  For this reason, I quickly dismissed it as an airplane.  As my friend continued to search for a star for a bit, I tried to figure out the light again.  By this time, the light had not significantly moved in any direction, and appeared stationary to me.  The light was still phasing.  I told my friend to stop bothering with the telescope, and to just look at the light with his naked eye.  We began discussing what it could be.  By now we had both agreed that it was not an airplane because it was not moving significantly, and that it was not a star, because it was a phasing orange blue light.  I had him focus in on it with the telescope.  It didn‚Äôt take long before we found it, and it appeared to look like a ball of orange with a blue aura around the edges.  Also, it seemed to change colors between orange and blue/green  The image was probably less than half the size of what the moon looked on the same telescope, from the same spot.  The oddest part of the object was that the insides of the ball seemed to have little dots and random patterns in them.  When I first noticed, I was instantly reminded of biology videos you see in school, with the cells being looked at from under a microscope with the little dots inside the cells moving around.  It was all very odd.  We could see the ball seemed to change colors from orange to blue/green and combinations of orange/blue.  Both me, and my friend were very confused and didn‚Äôt understand what it could be.  We also noticed with our naked eyes that the light seemed to be moving a bit.  We were pretty sure that it was not an eye trick, but the object seemed to move side to side.  After about 10-15 minutes of watching the object, it began to slowly disappear in a short span of about 10 seconds.  As it continued to phase, it slowly became dimmer, and was gone.  It might have been that the light got further away from us, or that it just stopped being visible.  We did not know what the case was.  This was at 11:06 PM.  At 11:14 PM, we saw another light with similar characteristics to the first one, however, it was much closer to the horizon, and must have been at a much farther distance, because the light was very small compared to the old one.  The light appeared to have a more orange/red color and had much more slight back and forth wavy motions to it.  Even under the telescope, the light was a spec compared to the other light.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 1/8th of the size of the other light that we had through the telescope just minutes before.  We could not see any of the cell type characteristics on the telescope, because the light was just a tiny orange colored dot on it.  We were not sure if this light had any correlation to the previous one, but we did not rule it out, because this one had appeared to us out of nowhere.  At about 11:26, we noticed the light was getting dimmer, until after about 20 seconds we could not see the light anymore.  We might have dismissed these lights as something random, but after seeing the craters on the moon so clearly, then seeing the ball of light behaving so oddly and appearing so different, we knew it was not something wrong with our eyes or the telescope.  Something was definitely different here, but what it was, we don‚Äôt know.  Please feel free to contact me, I am very curious as to what this might have been.",

The object appeard to have 3 solid red lights, close together in a vertical triangular shape.  It had a flashing white light very similar to an airplane marker light and that's why I didn't initially react to it.  The object was about the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length or maybe just a bit larger.  It moved slowly traversing no more than about 10 degrees arc, primarily traversing from our right to left, back and forth, up and down.  It was absolutely silent.  Unfortunately, we had no frame of reference to guage its size or distance from us. I joked about a UFO but also suggested a drone closer to us as it seemed a more likely explanation.  However, if it was a drone, I would have thought we would be able to hear it. None of us was remotely frightened but all were very curious.",

     "text":"Five reddish-orange lights over Waldport , Oregon in the SW sky Family and friends,  While standing on our deck tonight at around 10:35 PDT we witnessed something amazing.  It was a perfect evening with no wind, clear skies and mild temps.  I was sitting out on our deck.  I had been playing a very soft tune on my guitar that I was making up.  My thoughts were of how perfect the night was, and how much I was enjoying connecting with my guitar.   I looked up, toward the SW, and what appeared to be rising over the roof tops were five orange/red lights suspended in front of me.  They just floated there, in a formation of two at the top in a horizontal line and three below . All lights were evenly spaced in the formation.  The individual lights were not spherical when close/brightest, but  vertically elongated in a line like a lower case i without the dot. They were very short, \"1 degree tall,\" not long lines of light.  I cannot say how far away the lights were.  There was no noise. The lights simply hovered/floated at first.  When first seen, all of the lights appeared in a space about 10 degrees wide and about 15 degrees in height in the sky.   At first, they seemed to be directly over the rooftops of the houses fronting the ocean.  The lowest light seemed about two hands above the rooftops.  The lights were as bright as the waxing gibbous moon, but reddish-orange in color.  They reminded me of brightly glowing embers, but did not flicker, pulsate or change in intensity until they began to move away/fade. The words that come to mind are suspended formation. I did not understand what I was seeing, and looked upon the lights as a small child might view a new discovery for the first time. I was spell-bound.  Two began to slowly drift out of view/fade toward what seemed to be a southerly direction.  At this point, I snapped back into reality and ran to get my son.  He hurried outside in time to see a formation of three lights in a horizontal line about three hands above the roof tops.  As we both watched, he realized we needed pix of this. We both ran to get our cameras and tried getting some shots without the flash.  Mine didn't come out; his did!! It shows the lights near the final moments of their display when only two remained.  He also got some video that we are processing now.  Due to auto focus and distance, the lights only appear as round orbs.  The pix were taken when the lights were much farther away/fainter than when they first appeared as the group of five.  I know these were not propelled by the wind.  The movements were too deliberate as they changed position, then remain fixed again. I feel blessed to have witnessed this!!!  This was an experience that he and I will treasure and share forever!! We know what we saw!!!  NO, they were not helicopters.  We see them all the time and they do not move like this, nor do their lights remain in the exact position.  With the changing viewing angles helis show their red, green and white lights.  There were no green or white lights.  There was no noise. Flares don't move in this way either since the lights would rise, fall, move left and right very slowly.  I have not ruled-out the possibility than five remote controlled devices could have created this, but the power source/batteries for the lights would need to be very heavy to have kept the lights at the high intensity and duration we observed. What did we see!!! He and I both agreed that nothing of this Earth that we knew of moved in that manner in inner or outer space.   We clearly BOTH witnessed an anomaly.  Was it extra-terrestrial?  Was it local?  Was it spiritual?  We don't know.  I can only swear to you that it happened.",

     "text":"Red/orange orb interacts with jets, chased by more jets, re-appears 4 days later. This is a descriptive account of two incidents of personal eyewitness accounts of a reddish orange orb.  The first indecent occurred on January 20th at approximately 10:20 pm in SW New Mexico, just outside of Silver City. At first there were three of us outside, me, m and c.  We were about to leave m's house when I saw what appeared to be a plane and some distance behind it and approaching it quickly was a reddish/orange orb.  There was a distinct difference in the speed of the orb and the speed of the plane.  The orb was obviously traveling faster than the plane. Then a second plane was visible behind the orb, and all were traveling together (plane, orb, plane) with the orb somewhat lower than the two planes.  It was peculiar that there was no sound from these planes or orb.  We were out in the outskirts of town where it was very quite and we could hear very well, that there were no jet engines.  Then, as all three objects are flying due west, the orb shakes up and down violently a  very small distance, shaking the planes up and down as well. Next was beyond belief.  The orb very obviously sped up to the first plane and went into or behind it, disappearing from view.  It almost immediately came out as 2 orbs of identical color.  It is vital to note that the orb was not only much smaller than the outline of the lights on the planes, but that it did not flash like the planes did.  These planes also did not flash like the regular commercial flashing plane light.  The planes seemed to be communicating with each other using their lights, it did look like Morse code, now that I replay it in my mind.  (My current hypothesis is that the orb had already taken control of the planes by the time I had seen them, and all the pilots had to communicate with one another was their lights!) Immediately after the 2 orbs came out of the plane in front, all of the objects lights' turned out, the orb was dim like a star, as were the planes, most strange, at the same time this happened, they all turned towards the south and merged to form an equilateral triangle with the point directed upwards, facing us.  This triangle appeared to have a mass connecting the lights. There were no clouds in the sky, the stars were very bright, and the light of the city was blocked by a ridge.  The triangle slowed down its movement to a crawl yet still covered a massive distance very quickly, circling from West, to South, to East, and finally North East while it disappeared into what appeared to be space. Not five or ten minutes later c and I were preparing to depart from m's, we were amazed to see the reddish/orange orb floating straight up from the north.  I thought to myself what would I do to communicate with this orb, and I thought maybe I would whistle.  Before I could even whistle and directly after the thought, the orb light went out.  The star sized light that remained floated upward and southwest until it realized two more jets were coming in from the north east.  I heard the roar of the jets  as they flew the trail of the orb all the way over us towards the North and West, south into Mexico. Tonight, January 24th , 2012, I was witness again to this phenomenon, yet it was slightly different.  I was sitting on my front porch facing South West when I saw the red light again, this time smaller and what appeared to be 2 orbs very close to one another and fainter.  It was also earlier in the evening, approximately 8:20 pm, and the city lights reduce visibility.  Still the stars are highly visible in Silver City, NM.  I watched as the pair of orbs moved in a similar flight path as the Friday night before.  The lights pulsated or flashed irregularly, almost more of a pulsation.  It went from West, to South, to East, and disappeared behind the trees.  I watched it circle around 3 times before it disappeared the final time. But before it dipped behind the trees for the last time, it glowed a brilliant orange/red much brighter and larger than the orbs we had seen the previous Friday.  It quickly faded and went away behind the trees.  It was interesting to see how the flight path of these pair of orbs was directly compared to that of observable commercial flights at the time and to note the irregular flight path of the paired orbs, and the straight path of the commercial flights. The paired orbs traveled at a much higher speed than that of the observable commercial flights.  They also had no noise.  This where it is puzzling.  Very soon after the orb glowed that burst of orange/red light, it went away, and minutes later 2 fighter jets zoomed by, completely audible and loud, just like the 2 jets that went after the one orb on Friday.  But unlike those two that pursued the orb into Mexico, these two jets did not appear to know where they were going, just going really fast in the same flight path as where the paired orbs were 5 minutes prior, and pretty much where the first occurrence turned into an equilateral triangle. Yet when we first witnessed this on Friday, there was no noise when the planes were incorporated into this triangle, and there was no noise tonight with the paired orbs, we could hear the commercial flights when they passed by, we could hear the Air Force jets zooming by, but no, we could not hear the orbs at all.  The whole time the orbs flew with remarkable speed and smoothness, and made irregular and seemingly impossible movements, like moving a large distance while appearing to move slowly.  This was particularly present in the triangle form.",

     "text":"A cylinder of blue pulsing light and some sort of craft concealed in a thick low hanging cloud On December 15, 2007 around 9:30 p.m.  my husband and I were heading home.  We were on the Southside of Birmingham and were driving up Arlington Avenue South to cut through to Montclair Road via Carlisle Road.  We live in the Crestwood/Irondale area of Birmingham.   The weather was in the low 60's and overcast and a bit gusty and there was rain in the forecast.  Not really unusual for the south but for some reason it just felt odd almost the way it feels before a thunderstorm or even a tornado.  When we turned onto Montclair from Carlisle, we drove just a short distance approximately a quarter of a mile to where the Pilgrim Church is and we noticed through the trees and up to the left a flash of a very bright blueish light that lasted maybe a second.  We both expected to hear thunder or a boom from a transformer but we heard nothing.  As we continued on maybe another quarter of a mile, we were approaching a red light and intersection.  It should be noted that there is a ridge to the left that runs parallel to Montclair and at the intersection there is a post office to the left and just up from there is another building that houses the Orthopedic Specialists.   This ridge is mostly residential.  As we were about to pass under the red light (speed limit is 25)  to our surprise the brilliant blue light reappeared on the ridge just behind the Orthopedic Specialists building. We were maybe 500 feet from it so you could see it very clearly.  What we saw was truly amazing and we have never ever seen anything like it.   The light was a brilliant plasma blue. It seemed to pulse, it was bright but not blinding.  The cylinder was very large, approximately about 50 - 60 feet across and about 100-120 feet tall.  There seemed to be a cylinder within a cylinder.  The outermost cylinder had a very 3D appearance and the best way to describe it...a Hexagon.  It was slowly rotating counterclockwise.  The innermost cylinder was smooth but it didn't really seem to rotate. You could pretty much see through the cylinder but because of the light it definately had a hazy glow to it.   The cylinder extended up towards what appeared to be a circular stack of levels starting with the lowest level closest to the cylinder, which was made up of rectangle shaped lights arranged around the perimeter of possibly the bottom of a craft.  It too was rotating in a counterclockwise direction.  The next  3 levels stepped up and out and disappeared into a very dense low hanging cloud.  You absolutely could not see what was up in the clouds and I have to say that the cloud was unusually low and very dense and despite how windy it was seemed to just hang there.  The craft just hovered there and it lasted approximately 5 seconds.    Then just like a light switch it turned off.  There was no way to tell if the craft disappeared or if the light just turned off.  We continued traveling down Montclair and trying to put our minds around what we saw.  We had probably travelled less than a quarter of a mile and that took less than a minute when just like before it appeared again.  It seemed to be travelling very slowly along the top of the ridge.  When the light appeared it just seemed to hover over the houses along the top part of the ridge. Again, concealed in the cloud. This time we pulled over and rolled down the window.  There was no noise, no whir, no sound at all.  All of a sudden all of the lights to the left of Montclair Road where the craft was hovering all went out.  The entire neighborhood was cast into darkness.  Of course, curiosity getting the best of us, we decided to turn up into the neighborhood towards the area that the craft might be to see if by some chance we might catch a closer glimpse.  All of the houses were dark, no street lights....very eery but it was obviously gone.   As we made a U turn to go back down towards Montclair there was a very clear view of another ridge that is a few miles away and we could see transformers blowing one after another, maybe 5 in all . The saddest part is I actually had my camera in the backseat, why o why didn't I pull myself together enough to get out my camera and record the event.  At any rate, this was absolutely the most amazing thing that either of us have seen or experienced.    I have to say I have always been a skeptic but I just have no idea what this could have been but it definately seemed to have some purpose or intention in what it was doing.  What would that be?  I have no idea.",

     "text":"Oval shaped, color-changing lights, erratic movements, appearing and reappearing. My friend and I were outside in his backyard having a cigarette at about one in the morning when we noticed a strangely-lit object making a steadily-paced arch from left to right across the sky.  Too fast to be a plane, also the lights on the object were like nothing I've seen before on any aircraft.  The object was slightly disk-like, but more substantial.  I would say more oval-shaped than anything.  The lights moved in a horizontal line across the object in a dotty pattern and changed colors from pinkish-red to light green to white. For a short time it was very close but it moved further away, still in our sights but not as clear.  As it moved, the first thing that occurred to me that was odd about the flying object was the sound.  It was completely silent except for when it was closer at first, but even then it didn't sound like any kind of engine at all.  All we heard was a soft whirring wind noise.  Also, its movements were eerie and very strange.  Not like anything I've ever seen or heard of before. When it moved further away, it stopped traveling and started hovering in place.  The lights continued to revolve around itself in that dotty pattern and the only movement it made was a slow swinging from side to side. My friend and I were really weirded out and this point.  We kept trying to verbally convince ourselves that it was a plane or something of that nature, but it was becoming more and more obvious that it wasn't a plane at all. Then we both saw the object vanish into thin air without warning.  But almost a second later it reappeared in a new place directly to the left of its original spot.  We watched it do this several more times, disappearing and reappearing in new locations that were all relatively close together.  Its movements appeared very erratic, but effortless and swift at the same time.  Then the object started traveling towards us.  My friend and I were just staring at it, freaked out.  It looked like it was coming straight for us.  The object was rapidly growing larger in size as it closed the distance between us.  It was then that I noticed more things about the object.  There seemed to be a pinkish-purple haze surrounding it.  Also, the object didn't look remotely metallic or industrial.  It merely looked like an extremely dense concentration of energy in that oval-disky shape with the lights continuing to revolve around it.  I can't say for sure that the object even looked solid.  It was definitely substantial, but it looked to have formed out of a material that I couldn't begin to fathom, even now. It stopped midair and remained completely still for a long ten seconds.  At this time I could clearly make out its shape and the light patterns and color changes.  Then it shot directly over our heads to the left and traveled an insane measure of distance in about half of a second.  I wish I had a better sense of distance so I could be more accurate about this...  Anyway, at this time both my friend and I were convinced that this was something not of this world.  The movement was like no manmade aircraft I've ever seen.  The movement was precise and liquid and smooth when it traveled that fast.  Also, there was no sound.  A plane, number one: could not have gone that fast, and number two: would have made a very loud noise when it was that close to us. It then hovered in the left section of the sky, repeated the same swinging movements from before.  It was slowly moving further away.  My friend and I watched it for a little while longer until it disappeared from sight for good. Needless to say,  I really regret not having a decent camera function on my phone.",

     "text":"Multiple sightings of fireballs, orbs, cigar shaped crafts in Goldendale, Washington. Dear Mr. Davenport,   I am writing to report several UFO sightings I have witnessed over the past 4 years.  I am 33 years old, and have never seen a UFO before until 2010.  I am a mother of two children (10 and 8 years old) and do not use drugs or alcohol.  I am a stay at home mom who homeschools.  Along with myself, my husband and two children have been co-witnesses to the sightings.  One of my neighbors was also present during one of the sightings. In October 2010, I moved to Goldendale, Washington.  We had just bought our 5 acre property and were living in a fifth wheel while developing the property for a home.  Our property is 15 miles outside of town and is in the woods.  We had a small campfire and it was about 8pm at night.  My husband and I were standing outside around the campfire and the children were there as well.  It was a clear and cold October night sky.  My husband and I looked up, and right above the 70ft pine trees about 100 yards away, appeared a bright yellow light about the size of a washing machine and round in shape.  It was noiseless and moving towards us fairly slowly.  As it got above the trees that were right around us, it shot up straight into the sky as fast as you could blink and disappeared.  There was no noise.  We both saw this and the encounter lasted about 10-15 seconds.  My children did not see this one. The second sighting was in the winter of 2012/2013.  I got up in the middle of the night and went into my living room and looked out my windows.  Across the road, was a ploughed wheat field about 80 acres in size with pine trees flanking the sides and back of the field.   I witnessed another yellow orb hovering above the trees in the back of the wheat field.  It hovered for several minutes, and then it shot up in the air and disappeared.  I did not know if there was noise, as I was inside.  The orb was the size of a basketball from where I was.   The next day my neighbor, who lives about 15 acres down the road from me, came over and asked if I had seen the orb the night before at the back of the wheat field.  I verified that I had, and his description was the same as mine. The third sighting was the same time, winter of 2012/2013 and I was driving home from town with my two children. It was about 9pm.  To the north of town, there is a small mountain range called the Simcoe Mountains.  The children and I saw a huge neon green fireball shoot across the top of the mountain range and disappear.  The light was very bright and noticeable and lasted about 3 seconds.  It started out bright green, then turned a brilliant orange.  I do not know if anyone else from town saw this, but there were at this time, several places around the world on the news reporting fireballs in the sky. In the summer of 2013, my children were playing outside in the middle of the afternoon. They came bursting inside the house and said they saw a UFO and wanted me to come and look.  I went outside, and to my amazement, there was a metal, cigar or blimp shaped craft hovering above the woods.  It was not directly above us, but aways off and hovering about as high as a low flying helicopter.  It looked about the size of a washing machine from where we were but cigar or blimp shaped.  The sighting lasted 10 minutes and it just dissolved away before our very eyes.  It made no noise, and it hovered in place the whole time.  The children and I saw this same craft about 3 more times this summer.  At the last sighting, my neighbor was over talking with me in my backyard. The children who saw it first, pointed it out to us in the sky.  We all stood and watched it for about 10 minutes and it too dissolved and disappeared. The recent sightings were June of 2014.  The weather was warm and the children and I decided to camp outside on our trampoline for the night in our backyard.  There were clear skies that night. The stars were brilliant as we lay on the trampoline. The children and I witnessed about 100, what appeared to be 'stars,' moving about the skies.  They moved sporadically and they would get brighter and then appear to burn out and disappear after moving around the skies for several seconds.  There was one after another.  They would appear and carry on in the same fashion.  We called them 'bobbles'.  This went on about an hour and a half, in which we then decided to sleep in the house instead.  This was the week before the war in Israel started with Hamas. October 2014, on the night of the blood moon, I decided to stay up all night to see the moon eclipse.  At 3:30am, at the height of the eclipse, I woke my family up to come outside and see it.  My daughter and I walked out our back door first onto our back deck with my son and husband following behind.  As soon as my daughter and I reached the edge of the deck, we turned back towards our house to look at the moon which was above the house. At the ridgeline of the roof, a bright, white light appeared and flew along the entire roofline of the home.  It was an orb, very bright, brilliant white, and kind of had an appearance of a 'sparkler.'  The kind I used to play with on the fourth of July as a kid.  It was not more than a foot above the roof, and was about the size of a cantalope.  It lasted 3 seconds and my daughter and I gasped in amazement having both seen it.  My husband and son had not looked up in time, having therefore missed it. We marveled at the moon and described the orb we saw for several minutes, and at that point, my husband went back inside.  As the children and I walked off the deck and into the yard, we saw another orb just like the one a few minutes prior. It appeared  20 ft above us, flew for 3 seconds and fizzled out.  It too looked like a sparkler and was the same size.  All three of us saw this one.  There was no noise with either one. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

     "text":"North Carolina: On I-40 east bound 10/26/2014:large white circular orb and lost an unexplainable hour and a half!. UFO above I-40 Between Old Fort and West Morganton, North Carolina At 10 pm last Sunday night, October 26, 2014 I was driving I-40 east-bound on my way home to Rocky Mount from a weekend checking on my elderly mom in Hendersonville, NC. I left at 6:30 pm, took 26 west in heavy traffic to Asheville by 7PM, and then took 40 east. I came over the Black Mountain Pass and stopped at the Old Fort McDonald‚Äôs for a quick break and was back on the road about 8:00 pm.  It was dark by then. I drove east on I-40 for about half an hour, when suddenly I noticed above me and ahead of me the thick edge of a brightly shining luminous white disk hanging in the night sky.  It was very high up, but right over the road. It did not move.  The dashboard clock said 10 PM! What!????   I was between a steep mountain ridge paralleling the road on my right, to the south, and a hillside to the north.  Both sides of the road were heavily wooded as far as I could see in the dark. I could not see any houses or lights anywhere.  I looked for a mile marker, but didn‚Äôt find one. The object was amazing.  It was as if I Iooked straight on to the side of a doughnut, then lifted it up to about an 11:00 position. I could see the brilliant white light and the thick wide curves of the right and left sides.   I drove under it a few minutes later, with some trepidation. I thought the object might be a reflection of some sort off the windshield, so I opened the sunroof completely, sliding the glass back all the way.  Looking up thru the open sunroof, I could see that it was a perfect white circle with three very bright green circular lights under it, quite pretty.  They looked exactly like the three circular razors on the head of an electric Norelco razor.  Neither the white object nor the three green lights beneath it appeared to spin, move, or rotate, though.  There was no sound or vibration.  It was not a balloon. What was it? The atmosphere was clear and not misty or foggy, so there were no perceptible light beams through the air. There was not wind that night. I thought it might be a house on the mountain to my right. However, the mountain was very steep and I could see the darker ridge line lower down to my right against the sky, farther away. There were no lights on the mountain. So the brilliant light was not coming from anything on the mountain itself. It was above me and not over on the mountain. To my left was the west bound lane and heavy woods and trees and another steep slope whose top I could not see for the trees. There were no lights to my left either. Above me, there were no clouds in the sky. The object was against a starry sky. The moon was up that night, but it was to the south-southwest, according to the moon app on my cell phone, and it was out of my vision range, south of the high mountain ridge to my right somewhere. The bright object was definitely not the moon or any planet. It was way too big for that. The light was brilliant, but not blinding. If I put my hands up and held them about a foot apart, that‚Äôs how big it appeared when I first saw it, as I approached it. Looking up through the open sunroof, I heard no sound and did not feel anything. The object was completely still in the air, not moving, not rotating, just hovering up above and very slightly off to the side, to the right/south of I-40. It was lower than the mountain ridge to my right. It was closer to the road than to the mountain. As I drove under it, I was a little scared, but nothing happened. I would say it was at about the 1:00 position above the highway. There was no other traffic around me on the east bound lane. Since I was looking up, I didn‚Äôt notice if there was any traffic coming toward me on the west bound lane.I passed a small unlit exit on my right leading downwards to the south, but passed it too quickly to catch the number. Then, I came into trucks and had to take my eyes away. When I looked back, I couldn‚Äôt see the object anymore because the road curved. I came up to the Morganton exit, several minutes after I saw the object. I don‚Äôt know how to explain the missing time between 8:30 and 10:00 pm. It doesn‚Äôt take an hour and a half to drive between Old Fort and Morganton! I was driving between 65 and 70 miles an hour, so I couldn‚Äôt have fallen asleep. I left Asheville at about 7pm, and Old Fort about 8:00, so I should have been past Statesville by 10 PM. My dashboard clock is accurate. I will be 67 this month. I am a retired school teacher and live near Rocky Mount, NC. I don‚Äôt smoke, drink, do drugs, or mess around. I have backpacked around the world twice and am an avid hiker and trekker. As a teacher, I am rational, objective, and factual. I don‚Äôt believe in UFO‚Äôs. I have never seen one. However, I try to keep an open mind and entertain possibilities without judgment. What did I see? And what happened to me in the missing hour and a half? Perhaps I made a mistake? I think I will make the drive again soon and double check the time and my position. I know that steep mountain ridge, just not sure exactly where it is. I tried to check on Google Earth, but it does not give elevations, so I could not tell exactly where I was. Surely, there must be an explanation. Photo?  My phone was dead and charging, but it would have been dangerous to do while driving, and I didn‚Äôt feel safe stopping that late at night in such a location.  Frankly, I MUST have seen a UFO, what else could it have been?  Yes, I have lost time twice before that I know of; once at twelve years old and once in India in 1976. I have no explanation. I experienced a great sense of urgency both times, but don't know why. ‚ÄúThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophies.‚Äù  Hamlet, Scene V -W.

     "text":"UFO chases car 8 miles. 4 witnesses. Several sightings afterward. Kim, Terri, and I were driving to Nikki's house, Kim's cousin (about 6:30pm). We were all about 17-18 years old and it was Valentine's day.  Nikki and Kim were living about a 1/2 mile from each other in a remote farming area.  It was dark and the roads were icy. Kim's mother had reported numerous times to her family that there was a UFO that followed her to work daily.  Each morning the lit object would wait for her above the mail box and one day, she claims the object beamed down a light and flew over the hood of her car.  On one hand, I believed her because she is an honest \"no nonsense\" person, but on the other hand, it's definately something you need to see to believe!  Kim began seeing the object after her mother woke her up and pointed it out to her one morning. TO NOTE:  Kim has an uncle that is very paranoid of aliens being able to see him at night, to the point of shooting out the overhead farm lights.  He lived about 6-7 miles away.  My mother bought a telescope to watch the skies after seeing UFO's over Lake Miltona in the 80's.  My uncle has seen UFO's in Park Rapids, MN while jogging along wooded trails.  I have several friends and aquaintances who claim to have seen UFO's (about 10).  My husband says he used to watch UFO's while having field parties in Miltona in the early 90's. On Feb. 14th at about 6:30pm, my friends and I picked up Nikki.  Terri was driving and Kim was in the passenger seat.  I was sitting in the back seat of a 4-door car.  When we pulled into the driveway, Kim yelled, \"See, there it is!  That's what I've been seeing!\"  We all observed a UFO hovering above the silo.  Nikki had also seen it and immediately jumped into the back seat.  The object was round and white in appearance.  Although it was bright, the light appeared to be self-contained, meaning that it didn't emit light like a flashlight or lightbulb. When we drove away, the object came straight down from the sky and then followed along-side the vehicle.  It was about the size of our car.  It followed along the ditches, move up over trees and power lines, then would dip back down along side us.  It was icy and we took back roads (gravel) for 8 miles to my mother's house in Miltona, MN.  All of us were hysterical and crying, yelling at Terri to drive faster.  There was no other traffic on the gravel roads and but Terri had to drive slowly. Once we hit Highway 14, the object moved higher up into the sky and moved behind us.  A large beam of light came down like a helicopter spotlight. I felt like something snapped in my brain. I'm not sure how to explain it, but it seemed nearly audible. This is the point at which I'm not sure exactly what happened.  I'm not sure if I imagined what COULD have happened,or if it actually DID happen.  The car was stopped. No one was screaming or crying and everyone else was staring straight ahead, motionless.  There wasn't any lights on the dash, no clock, etc., and the car wasn't running. I think there was a small man (being) next to my car door.  We had locked all the doors upon seeing the UFO.  The man telepathically told me to open the door and I refused.  It said, \"We're going to get in anyway.  Make it easier on yourself and unlock the door.\"  I reached over and unlocked it and don't remember anything else. BUT, it was as if we DIDN'T stop the car. The light had come out and chased us, closing in on us slowly, and just when it was almost on top of us, a car came from the other direction and it was gone in a flash, going in the other direction. I had regression hypnosis to help me remember this incident, and as it turns out, I'm just one of those people who can't be hypnotised. What luck! But, I was able to recall details just from simply telling the story to the hypnotist over and over again. It seemed that each time I could remember another small little detail. But, when it comes to the spot where I'm not sure if we stopped or not, I was confused each time. I simply came up with, \"and then it was gone and we went to my house.\" My friend also had hypnosis and swears that she and her cousin were taken up into a spaceship. I was not present at her hypnosis session, but she said it was pretty intense. Over the next two months or so, I saw the UFO several times at my house (daily, sometimes). It would come after dark and it seemed immediately after I fell asleep. I would wake up feeling as though something was staring intently at me and would open my eyes to see it outside my window. It would change shapes to the shape of the moon (half moon, crescent, full moon, etc.) and would also change colors (white, yellow, orange). It did not have flashing colors, but would be one full color at a time. Once, it turned blood red as I reached for the phone to report it to the police as a sighting. I was scared to go to sleep and felt like no one could possibly identify with me what I was going through. I eventually saw it less and less, but did start seeing it again about 3 years ago, spurring me to pursue the hypnosis. Before the hypnosis session, I swear that I woke to a female alien standing next to my bed reaching over my abdomin area. A few hours later I woke up laying crosswise on my bed without the covers on. I also had an incident where I woke up sleep walking, chasing a very short man out of my room. I dismissed it as a dream, but after going to the bathroom to take a drink of water, I noticed that the UFO was, once again, sitting outside the window! CRAZY! A few days later, I saw the UFO in daylight gliding across the sky. It did this for a few minutes, then quickly made a right angle and dashed away. That time I could see it was cigar-shaped, not round. I was curious as to whether or not other cars driving on the highway also saw it, but I guess I'll never know. I haven't seen it for quite some time now.",

At approximately 23:30, I went out onto the deck to have a cigarette, facing South-East I noticed three strange chevron shaped objects. The lights were mainly white but changed to blue and to green over a period of thirty seconds. I tried timing them mentally to predict what color would come next, however there was no logical order to the color pattern.  I called my two friends onto the deck to confirm what I was seeing and after approximately twenty minutes two more lights appeared. It appeared as if one of the larger objects was emitting the smaller objects, which also resembled the same shape.  The objects slowly rotated around each other in a clockwise motion. One of the objects moved farther away from the others into the West of the sky. The movement was not smooth, rather sporadic. Eventually it returned to its orbiting formation with the other crafts.  After roughly forty-five minutes I began to get tired and had smoked nearly a pack of cigarettes watching this scene. One or two of the crafts got too far away to view any longer and I went to sleep. At a family dinner with my aunts, uncles, and cousins I mentioned seeing the lights. They said they saw the same thing and were puzzled by it as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

At around 8:30, 8:45.. I could see what would looked like \"star dust\" seemingly emitting from Venus in two trails in a 45 degree downward trajectory, headed by a very small  blinking white light. This \"object,\" from my point of observation, was moving at a very slow pace. The light and trail so faint, barely visible to plain eye. From the North, a white/blue light was shooting across the sky in a jagged flying pattern. Sometimes the light would disappear for a second, reappear above the moon, disappear again and reappear moments later in a position below the moon.. all the while heading South until disappearing behind the landscape. By this time I had entered the \"Phoenix Bypass Route\" which is where the I-8 meets up with 85 North heading back up to I-10 W. It was just before 8:55 pm.. I just made the switch onto the 85 North. What looked like a flare being \"shot out of\" Venus, and also at a 45 degree angle, started gaining acceleration towards the ground. As the \"flare\" flew closer to the earth, it appeared to change in color.. ranging from bright white.. to pinks and finally a white-blue. This streak of light.. or this \"fireball,\" also appeared to be growing larger and brighter as approaching the ground. I remember feeling like I was about to see a spacecraft crash into a field just to the north of me. I remember preparing myself for the \"impact.\" Before the object touched down, I stopped my truck short in the middle of the freeway and did a 180 degree turn, with the intentions of following the object for the rest of its voyage. Just before it hit the ground.. the object leveled out in a seamless motion, and it shot across the terrain... a white fireball (the light smaller now), and in a \"zipping\" like motion, this object hovered and glided gracefully above the ground before disappearing behind some nearby desert terrain. I also realize I was near an airport, but this was not a plane.",

     "text":"A multi craft formation of various shapes and sizes. It was in the early eighties, probably June or July, (I‚Äôm assuming summer time because we were at the lake for the weekend). My brother and a herd of our friends had converged on Lake Whitney located in North Central Texas to our favorite spot, Soldiers Bluff. We partied well into the night, and it wound up being just myself, my brother and two or three friends that were still awake at 2:00 am. While the two or three friends stayed at the campsite talking and playing cards, my brother and I went fishing off of Soldiers Bluff. It was there, while sitting on an ice cooler, rod in hand‚Ä¶eyes on the stars, that we witnessed this event.  I had noticed a white light moving across the sky that was to close to be a satellite in orbit. As I watched this light, I noticed a smaller one appear next to it that I assumed was the other ‚Äúwing light‚Äù of the ‚ÄúPlane‚Äù and that it was turning towards us. As it continued to ‚ÄúTurn‚Äù, (One was slightly higher than the other) the lights got further and further apart. The further apart they got, the more I thought to myself ‚ÄúMy God, That‚Äôs a HUGE Plane. As they leveled off, seven smaller lights appeared to swoop into formation with the other two lights. They now were heading in the opposite direction they had originally been traveling.  The first light was very large and round and white. This was being followed by seven smaller round white lights. The light taking up the rear was a large white rectangle. We stared in total disbelief as the 9 craft soundlessly floated across the sky in front of us.  We remarked to each other as to what they could be and finally decided it was a small plane pulling a lighted banner. AS SOON AS I said that to my brother, the craft in the rear raised up slightly higher than the others and SHOT forward halfway up the formation, very quickly, where it stopped and slowly floated down thru them to be below them where it hung there motionless until the last little light passed it. As the last light passed over it, It raised back up behind the last little light and continued across the sky, taking up the rear, till they were finally indiscernible. We had asked our friends if they had seen them also. They said that they had, but I don‚Äôt believe that they did, due to their  lack of astonishment (that was very evident in my brother and I) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

     "text":"Flat black color, 6-legged, toy jack shaped, basketball-sized object on the ground melting snow in a squall This report is about a snowy winter night in 1968, 1969 or 1970.  That is the best I can pinpoint the ‚Äòancient history‚Äô from my past. The unidentified object was shaped very similarly to a jack in the child‚Äôs game of ‚Äòball & jacks‚Äô. It was on the ground, tilted so its low side faced the city.  It was flat-black color. Its circumference was slightly larger than a basketball. Toy jacks that I recall had 4 legs radiating outward from a center axis.  This object had 6 legs.  Two front legs were feet-on-the-ground, facing the city.  Two legs were a bit off the ground and to the left and right sides of the ‚Äòface‚Äô.  Two ‚Äòrear legs‚Äô in the back of the ‚Äòjack‚Äô were off the ground facing uphill. It was an odd configuration because whoever saw it asked, at least instinctively, ‚ÄúHow could 4 legs off of the ground be outweighed by the 2 front legs that were on the ground and tilted to face the city?‚Äù  This basketball-sized jack with the flat-black finish was sitting halfway up a hill in Grandview City Park in the Pittsburgh, PA. A neighborhood named ‚ÄúMount Washington‚Äù overlooks Pittsburgh. Mt. Washington has two well known vantage points that gaze across the river at the downtown skyscrapers.  These vantages are Grandview Avenue and Grandview Park.  They are on opposite ends of the neighborhood. Grandview Avenue got lots of pedestrian and vehicle traffic.  Grandview Park got much less, especially during winter. The park has an observation deck near the main entrance.  Uphill from the deck, the park is ‚Äòterraced‚Äô by 3 service roads. Atop the hill are 2 huge water tanks.  The park‚Äôs lowest road is its main service road (no public access for vehicles].  It‚Äôs between the hill and the observation deck.  This road is 2 vehicles wide. There are 2 more single-lane service roads.  They are further up the hillside. The position of these roads gives a framework for the remainder of this report. The highest service road goes to the water tanks.  At its apex it was about 60 yards (175‚Äô) higher than the main service road.  The middle service road was about 40 yards (125‚Äô) above the main service road. I know these distances because on snowy nights I practiced playing football.  Specifically, while walking our family‚Äôs fearless German Shepherd, I played quarterback.  I threw snowballs at trees. They were adjacent to the service roads and spaced apart at intervals of 10 to 50 yards.  I knew the distances with respect to the same distances on a football field. Facing the water tanks and, thus, facing away from the city, the large hill is gumdrop-shaped.  At its base is the main service road.  The highest and midway, single-lane service roads curve across the face of the hill.  They intersect at the main road. This particular night I walked Duke (the dog) up to the top of the hill.  It was snowing medium hard.  We could see only the brightest lights of the nearest downtown buildings.  And those lights were fuzzy & foggy.  The same was true for visibility of the park‚Äôs service road street lights at the opposite end of the park‚Äôs main entrance.  Only the 2 of us were walking through the park. The snow was ankle deep to mid-calf, depending on drifts formed by the wind.  The snow was deep enough that the wind that whistled through the park during winter had not yet blown any spots bald to render them devoid of snow. We walked along the highest service road over the crown of the hill facing the city, walked down the hill to the midway service road, to double back to where we entered.  Duke was usually rambunctious and very curious.  He knew my game of snowball football. Sometimes, he liked to race me to where my snowball hit a tree.  That night we‚Äôd done some casual racing in the snow to about 10 trees. We got to one of his favorite places to race & run.  The next tree was about 40 yards away. He liked hearing ‚Äúpop‚Äù when my snowball hit that tree.  He liked to take-off as he watched its flight.  But he didn‚Äôt on that night.  He shied away from hurrying toward that tree. He avoided the upside of the service road and stayed his leash‚Äôs length away on the downhill side toward the city. He usually preferred the uphill side because other dogs marked their spots on the uphill side. As we made our way toward the tree I‚Äôd just hit with a snowball, I noticed a depression in the snow on that service road.  I couldn‚Äôt yet see it clearly because the city lights and park street lights were dimmed by medium-heavy snowfall, but there was definitely something dimensionally odd about a point in the snow near tree I‚Äôd just hit. The nearer we got to my new ‚Äòline-of-scrimmage‚Äô (the tree), the more Duke was reluctant to continue. He always led the charge toward any new curiosity.  But he didn‚Äôt this time.  As I got nearer, I saw a circular black spot with almost no snow on the asphalt service road. Then I started seeing the jack-shaped, object dormantly sitting there. I got about 2-3 yards away from it.  Duke stayed with me although he had enough leash to go sniff it -- which he‚Äôd done with everything before and after our encounter with that object; put his nose right on or in it. I did not feel heat radiating from the jack, but heat had to explain why there was no snow in the radius around it.  I ventured to a bit more than an arm‚Äôs length away.  I picked up a pinch of the fluffy snow and sprinkled it toward the jack.  A bit of my sprinkling landed on it and was gone in less than 2 minutes.  It took only slightly longer to vanish than the regular snow falling on and around it. Meanwhile, I studied it as closely as I dared.  I saw no seams, nothing that resembled a hatch or window.  Yet I had the distinct sense that it was specifically facing the city lights; almost like admiring the view through the snow while enjoying the calm & silence of such a snowfall.  At the same time I had a definite sense of ‚ÄúHands OFF!  Don‚Äôt touch!‚Äù   The center of the jack had the biggest pod/cylinder; both in diameter and height.  At the end of each leg were smaller-scale versions of the same pod.  The pods were approximately the same diameter as the legs that connected them to the center core.  If they were different diameters, then it was by a mere millimeter or less; measurable only with calipers.  Small as it was it didn‚Äôt seem spindly.  It seemed sturdy.  It didn‚Äôt seem hostile, but it wasn‚Äôt inviting or overtly friendly.  It emitted a sense (or invisible aura) of power . . . not energy, but of power. Duke inched nearer to it only as I did. I was his shield and security.  This was totally out of character for our fierce, fearless dog.  I‚Äôd always needed to restrain him. He was a trained attack dog that K-9 police gave us because he was too aggressive ~ until he encountered this jack. This whole encounter was 3-5 minutes. I stepped past the jack, threw a few more snowballs at my next possible (football receiver) trees, drifted back to the jack for one last look, and saw no changes.  Then we returned home.  My snowballs were unusually accurate that night; missing 1 or 2 of 75-80 throws.  The next day my brother took Duke for his morning walk.  I told him about the black jack.  He looked for it.  It was gone. But where I‚Äôd seen it there was a divot in the snow shaped like the bottom of a basketball. Thinking about it you‚Äôve got to ask: ‚ÄúWhy was all of the ground below it devoid of snow?  Why not only where just the front feet touched the ground?  How did the black jack get there?  Obviously, it didn‚Äôt walk or tumble there. Why were there no tracks or footprints in the virgin snow?‚Äù  That made no sense. It had been snowing for 2-3 hours.  Anyone/thing moving afoot through the park would have left telltale tracks. And, Duke very cautiously and tentatively stuck his nose only so close as if a spherical energy field was radiating outward from the jack, just 1-2 inches beyond the full length of the jack‚Äôs legs.  My observation was that Duke knew or sensed something to the effect, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs as near as you get!‚Äù  But maybe it was selective/smart shielding because snow was OK for touching the jack. These are my thoughts articulated today (November 2013) but at least subconsciously in my 15-17 year-old awareness during the encounter.  It was weird, semi-spooky, and it simply ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt add up‚Äù.  While looking at it I pondered picking it up and taking it home to show Dad (a master engineer of power plants, steel mills and water processing facilities).  But Duke avoided the jack as though it was the Plague -- a sign to duly consider.  And I had no idea of where to put it, what to do with it, and it ‚Äòfelt‚Äô too strange. The jack looked different than all other UFO configurations/shapes that I‚Äôd seen before and that I‚Äôve seen since.  I kind of have regrets about this probably dubious ‚Äòopportunity‚Äô.  But I played it safe and I‚Äôm still alive to tell you about it. ----------- Completing the end of this report form . . .  Contact me if you want.  I can not accept (pay for) a collect call.  I don't prepay my phone with so much money.  Also, I did not see the object land.  It was already on the ground when I saw it.  Now, I live in Spain.",

     "text":"Large white sphere on the Mesa in Mesquite Nevada This sighting occurred on February 1, 2014, around 7:15 pm from my house in the small city of Mesquite, Nevada.  My house is on a ridge that looks down into the neighborhoods below and I have a direct view of the Mesa on the west of the city.  I don‚Äôt know how far away the top of the Mesa is from my house but I cannot tell if people are standing on the Mesa, they would be too small.  I can see very small Joshua trees that grow on the edge of the Mesa buy they are extremely small. On this night I walked into my bedroom, the lights were not on.  I looked toward the large windows on the west end of my bedroom and noticed a narrow ring of lights surrounding a very large gray circle.  It was as if something was blocking the lighted object behind the gray circle.  It seemed like the object was hanging in the sky just in front of the top of the Mesa.   As I walked toward the window I thought it was the moon, but realized it was much too big to be the moon and in a position in the sky the moon is never in.  Then the object began to light up.  It was a very large white sphere, bigger than a hot air balloon and perfectly round.  It was now hovering above the Mesa.  On each side of the sphere there seemed to be spotlights shining up on the sphere.  The sphere was made of a material that reflected light and made the sphere look shiny and smooth.  There was also light illuminating from the bottom of the sphere down onto the mesa this lighting was not as bright as ! the spotlight type lights.  There seemed to be black appendages attached to the bottom of the sphere.  The bottom of the sphere was very brightly lit but I could clearly see the top of the sphere though it was not as lit up.  I began to question what I was seeing in my mind.  I thought maybe it was four wheelers but realized their lights would not be bright enough to light up this object or for me to see from my house.  The top of the Mesa is only accessible by all terrain vehicles such as four wheelers and motorcycles.  There is not a power source in this area of the Mesa to provide power to a spotlight.  I could not figure out what I was seeing and as I kept watching it, the lights went out.  Now I could only see the gray white sphere but it seemed to be getting smaller.  It was not lit up at all only by the moon.  As I watched it, I realized it was getting smaller and very fast.  I ran into the living room and told my husband to get up and see this object.  He did not kn! ow where I was looking or what I was looking at and couldn‚Äôt s! ee it. Besides, by that time, the only thing left was the dome of the top of the sphere and it appeared to quickly sink into the ground with the rest of the sphere. As this event was taking place,  I looked down into the neighborhood below to see if cars were stopping to see this strange phenomenon but I didn‚Äôt see any cars traveling the roads or stopping to view this sight.  I then thought perhaps the casino, Casa Blanca, had an event but there had never been any advertising about this and there was no one around to watch it.  I checked the newspapers for the next few days to see if anything had been reported or if indeed the Casa had sponsored an event.  There was never a word mentioned about what I had seen.  I also asked many people around town and none of them had seen anything.  I asked my friend whose husband works for the power company if Nellis Air Force Base had asked them to shut down any power grids for maneuvers they may be performing, but nothing like that had occurred.  I also had her ask her teenage son if he knew if any of the kids had been up on the Mesa and were responsible for what I had seen.  They claimed no respon! sibility.  Another friend asked her Sunday school class if they knew anything about it but they said it was probably the super moon.  I checked that out too and the moon was a crescent during this time not a sphere.  I even looked in Las Vegas online papers to see if it had been reported there but no luck. I am a retired teacher with a masters degree and national board certification in education.  I taught school for 15 years and trained and taught student teachers at the university level.  I do not drink or take drugs of any kind.  I am so puzzled by this.  It has been on my mind continually since it happened so I am reporting it hoping I can forget it. I know this sounds very bizarre.  I did not get a picture but I did draw what I had seen so i wouldn't forget details. i just want to know I am not going crazy!",

I was driving north on hart st. heading towards a park which is approximately a mile south of the intersection of hart st. and U.S. 30.  As I was approaching the park, the road does a very slight left turn and has a slight decline which allows you to see the tree line, I saw a black object which looked triangle shaped at first but as I got closer I could see that it was more diamond shaped.  IT was a very sunny day out and I was wearing my prescription sunglasses and I was driving a work car back to the office.  I saw this object litterally staring at me or so it seemed.  It was looking right at me and I just stared at it the entire time.  I think it noticed that I was able to see it and it started to slowly drift towards its left (my right).  It was hovering above the tree line and just turned into the trees where I lost sight of it because i was then underneath it and lost sight because of the roof of the vehicle.  The very split second I lost sight of that, something told me to make a quick scan at the park to see if anyone saw this.  Not a single person saw this object, they were all playing soccer and tennis.  I was just in total shock when I saw this.  I should have stopped and got out of the car but you never know how one would react in a certain situation.  I saw this object very close and upfront.  It was a solid black metallic object.  Whatever this thing was, it simply defied any law of gravity.  It hovered about the tree line and didnt rustle a single leaf.  It made no noise whatsoever.  There was no exhaust coming out of it like you see with any vehicle and was apparently invisible to everyone except me. After this happened, I was in total shock.  I didnt even tell anyone until the next day and of course nobody believed me.  I tried to examine and research for any possible explanation and came up with nothing.  I was scared to death to really even talk about this to anyone aside from my closest friends and then once i told them, I never mentioned it again until many years later.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW IS REAL.  I came up with only one logical solution and its far fetched at that.  The only reason i saw this object on that sunny day in june is because I wear prescription sunglasses and I believe that these sunglasses were able to bend the rays of light and allow me to see this object.  I know this is far fetched but my sunglasses have this reddish tint in them that makes certain colors look different.  The sun looks reddish in these sunglasses especially around sunset.",

On May 26, 2014, at 1200 noon I glanced up from yard work to see something white in the sky.  I initially assumed it was a pair of geese flying together at a high altitude.  I thought one flew off to the left but one remained, which didn‚Äôt make sense and gave me pause.  As I concentrated on the object, I realized it wasn‚Äôt a bird at all but something round, shiny, and stationary.  I took a picture of it with my phone. From my yard, which is 40 miles NE of Sacramento, the direction was ESE at 45 degrees.  The altitude and actual distance were difficult ascertaining because I lacked a point of reference.  Judging from aircraft throughout the afternoon, I would assume it was higher than a helicopter and lower than a jet. I called and left a somewhat animated message for my fianc√© about this, then ran into the house for my glasses and binoculars.  I was afraid to leave the site I was standing for fear it would be gone when I returned.  I have to stress here that when I first saw the object,  I was only wearing protective safety glasses, not prescription, yet could clearly see it was round, white, and shiny. With the binoculars it was round like a ball, white, shiny, with bright light on the top, which could have been the sun‚Äôs reflection.  Sometimes the light became brighter, sometimes dissipated completely.  It was difficult to tell but it seemed as though there was something grey on the back of it that would occasionally be visible.  I wasn‚Äôt able to visualize any apparatus or ropes dangling from the bottom of it. In an attempt to eliminate the possibility I was imagining this, I called friends who were one mile away.  They saw the object, with the same coordinates, also stating it was shiny and unusual.  They gathered additional people to evaluate this, ensuring that the entire town would eventually be as crazy as we were.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos on weather balloons and read two articles, but I still wasn‚Äôt able to tell if this was a balloon or something else. The weather balloons online drifted and, while the photographers had to continually adjust the camera to follow them,  I didn‚Äôt.  What if it was Venus?  Or worse yet the Moon and I was creating perplexities out of the rational?  The mind is capable of creating any reality it wants to so I have tried to remain as logical about this as possible. I called the local airport.  I was told they had no reports of any sightings or weather balloons in the area and they expressed concern about flight paths.  I was asked if it could be an advertisement but it was much too high for that.  I was given two numbers for the FAA.  Since it was Memorial Day, the offices were closed so I left messages. The object remained stationary for over three hours, completely undeviating in location, my point of reference being between two trees.  The sun‚Äôs position was changing over my right shoulder and back, this was not.  By 1500 it began slowly drifting East, remaining at the same altitude.  It became increasingly difficult to find it in the sky until it eventually disappeared from view at 1630. I received return calls from the FAA this morning.  One person said it was likely a weather balloon, while another encouraged me to contact NUFORC.   I was told someone else reported a similar sighting, only 24 hours prior and 1 ¬Ω hours north of mine.  It is now 1200 on May 27.  There is presently nothing in the sky where this object was yesterday.  That, coupled with the fact that it traveled east, eliminates the planet theory.   I suppose a logical explanation would ensure our sensibilities.  The unexplained though, would make our current perceptions of reality a lot more interesting.",

     "text":"Skinny dark grey or black \"being\" It was around 10 pm on Saturday, December 16th, 2006,  when I left my cousins house.  I was headed to feed my horse (which is approximately a 20 minute drive).  It was a nice drive, the skies were clear with possibly a few higher clouds in the sky, but you could still see the stars.  I can‚Äôt recall if it was a full moon or not, but I know the moon was bright. The barn is in the back of a subdivision, at the end of a dirt road about a mile off the main road of the subdivision, backing up against a pipeline. The road is barely wide enough for 2 cars to pass one another in certain places. We had received a lot of rain in the past 2 weeks, so the road was well worn with large holes from the rain, as well as from the 18 wheelers that traveled the road headed for the M.U.D. maintenance facility near the barn.  Traveling the road in its condition, along with the deer that cross the road at all hours, at a pace of 10 miles per hour was the fastest, safest speed you could travel on this night. About halfway down the road (headed toward the barn), I started getting a strange feeling I was being watched. (I have had these feelings before, but just played it off in the past as though it was the horses or deer watching me.) Being how is was dark, I was alone (with my 6 year old son), and the barn is in an isolated area, I hurried to get the horse fed. It couldn‚Äôt have taken more than 10 minutes to fill his water bucket and give him his grain and hay. I locked the gate and headed back down the road towards the main street. As soon as I came around a curve, I noticed 2 red dots about 5 ¬Ω or 6 feet from the ground in the trees. My first though was it was an opossom sitting on a limb of a tree. I kept my eye on them because I couldn‚Äôt fiqure out why its eyes were so red. They were bright, bright red and had a glow to them. As I got closer I realized they were teardrop shaped and way too big to be an oppossom. The closer I got, I could see a silhouette of a being. Thinking it was a person standing there, I tried to see if I could recognize the person wondering why he was in the area so late. The body was very skinny, very dark grey or black in color with a very small pot-belly. It wore no clothing. Its hands didn‚Äôt seem to have any fingers, although it had a thumb-like appendage. The harder I stared at its face trying to make out any facial features, the less I could see. The face, although I could see the body perfectly, was very cloudy and continued to blur the harder I tried to see anything. The only movement I observed was the movement of the face/head as I passed it. It made no sound. As I rounded the next corner I stopped my car and put it in reverse, intending on backing up to take another look at what I had seen. I looked at the display clock on my dash and it read 12:30 am. It should have been reading no later than 10:35 or 10:40 pm. I put my car back in drive and left. The next day I was joking with my 14 year old son about what I had seen, never really thinking twice about it. Later that evening when I went to feed my horse he wouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with me. He went to the very back of his stall and would not come near me even when I put out his feed. For the next 2 months he acted in the same manner towards me. It wasn‚Äôt until the end of April 07 when my insomnia started coming back that I realized I had not had any problems going to bed and staying asleep. I had in fact been getting 9 hours of undisturbed sleep every night for the past 4-4 ¬Ω months. I have no photos, although, I could draw a picture of what I seen that night.",

     "text":"UFO lights near Kayenta, AZ On Wednesday, November 16th, 2011, at approximately 5:40p m in the town of Kayenta, Arizona 3 of my children and I were playing basketball outside on the drive way when we saw strange blinking lights in the Eastern sky from our position.  The temperature on that evening was about 40 degrees, not much of a breeze, no moon to show for, and the sun was about to set over the mesa in the west. My oldest daughter was the first to see the lights and then my third oldest son and then my second oldest daughter. My oldest daughter and my son called my name to get my attention to look at the lights.  When I turned to look, I only saw a light indigo/purplish color sky with the North Star shining bright about ¬º up into the sky. I said, \"Where?\"  My kids pointed and said, \"Right there!\"  They were pointing eastwards just beneath the North Star.  I repositioned myself on top of the bed of my truck. I had to re-focus my attention against the darkening sky.  Then I saw the lights.  The lights were like lights on an airplane or helicopter only it wasn‚Äôt. Aircraft lights was what came to my mind but how wide the lights made the object, changed that thought. There were about 15 blinking lights in a row (in a straight line pattern from our position).  Most of the lights were evenly placed from each other but on the left end there was a group of four lights that were close together (See small design below.  This design might change if copied and pasted). .     .  .  .  .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     . The lights were white in color and against the background of the sky were no bigger or brighter than the stars. The blinking lights were irregular and all blinked at different times.  All the lights were permanently placed but moved as a whole, as if it belonged to an immense spacecraft. I would place the unidentified object approximately 25-30 miles wide.  The distance from light to light for a majority of the even placed lights was approximately 2 miles.  From our position the unidentified object was approximately 40-50 miles away, 3-4 miles high and moving slowly in a North Western direction.  My wife and I calculated these numbers after hours of discussing the event and looking over pictures through the internet and television in the following 2 days. We could not see the outline or the unidentified object itself. We could see fog or somewhat looks like clouds beneath and surrounding the lights.  What was also strange about what we saw was that we could see the sky behind or through the blinking lights as if the object were transparent. I was thinking this object could not be of any aircraft on Earth. Not airplane, not helicopter, not hot air balloon, not weather balloons, or any unmanned drone. There was no sound coming from the object either. At approximately 5:46pm I called my wife who was at the local grocery store working. I was outside with my kids observing the object in the East when I called her. I told her we see lights of a UFO. She said, ‚ÄúWhere?!‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúTowards the East!‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúWait!‚Äù That‚Äôs when she went outside to look for herself. She said, ‚ÄúWhere is it at?!‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúDo you see the North Star?!‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúLook just below it! There is a line of blinking lights! Do you see it?!‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see it. I‚Äôm not good at looking at specific details‚Äù. I said, ‚ÄúJust look below the North Star. There is a line of blinking lights.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúYeah, yeah, yeah, I see it!‚Äù Then I said, ‚ÄúI recorded it on my phone. I got it on video‚Äù. When I checked my phone later that evening I couldn‚Äôt find the video. I discovered then that I didn‚Äôt actually record the sighting. I thought I pressed the record button but didn‚Äôt press it hard enough to initiate the recording. While observing the unidentified object in the East with my kids, I called my brother, who lives in Mesa, Arizona, at approximately 5:48pm. I said, ‚ÄúWe see lights of a UFO!‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúWhat? Where?‚Äù Then I explained to him exactly what I was seeing and what the UFO was doing. I asked my brother if he was near his computer. He said, ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù. I said, ‚ÄúLook up the phone number where we can report UFO‚Äôs and call me back.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúThe National UFO Center or something?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù At approximately 5:57pm I called the local Police Department to report the strange lights. I was outside with my kids when I made the call watching the unidentified object which was approximately in a North Eastern direction now. The dispatcher said, ‚ÄúPolice Department.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúHi, I would like to report‚Ä¶‚Ä¶is there a number where we can report strange objects‚Ä¶..cause‚Ä¶..this might sound kind of funny but I see‚Ä¶.‚Äù The dispatcher said, ‚ÄúYou mean the lights in the sky?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù. The dispatcher said, ‚ÄúWe already got calls about that‚Äù. I said, ‚ÄúOh, ok. Thank you‚Äù. Then at approximately 6:00pm I called my brother again. I returned back inside the house at this time. I asked him, ‚ÄúDid you find the number?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYeah‚Äù. I wrote down the number to the NUFORC to report the event. I first reported it to the NUFORC at 6:04pm. After reporting the incident, my kids and I stepped back outside into the night to check for the mysterious lights in the sky. The lights were now in a northern direction. At this time the night sky was clear. We could clearly see the stars and there were no longer any clouds or fog that we saw earlier when the object was located in the east. If there were traces of clouds or fog then the night sky hid it from our view. My 3 kids and I observed the unidentified object, from start to finish, for about 40 minutes until it disappeared over the horizon of rocks north of Kayenta at approximately 6:20pm. After it disappeared over the horizon my wife arrived home from work. At 6:23pm NUFORC called me back also wanting a written report of the event. At approximately 6:25pm my wife, kids and I got into our car and drove north to Monument Valley, UT hoping to witness the strange lights again. In the next hour or so, all we could see was about 10 airplanes flying throughout the Eastern and Northern skies. With nothing else exciting to see we headed back home.",

     "text":"Aggressive, Levitating Metallic Alien Robot thing A friend and I were relaxing at my remote cabin outside of Bella Vista, Ca.  We had just moved some furniture from Mt Shasta and were relaxing before heading back to his house in Redding.  I had witnessed many strange occurrences out there in the past; but this was by far the most unnerving and terrifying.  My senses were always heightened out there, way out in the woods, five miles out on a dirt road and 12 miles more to town on the highway.  My intuition told me to look out the window, and I saw a mist forming across the road about 20 yards away.  It was a warm summer night so this was unusual.  Over the course of about ten minutes, I looked twice more and the mist had thickened and expanded to about 3'x5' up on a dry grassy knoll at tree line.  It was not a full moon but the moon was bright that night. We decided to leave and when we went outside the mist had transformed into a chrome or steel colored, metallic, robotic looking, somewhat humanoid form.  It appeare! d to be sitting Indian-style in the grass. Sitting, it was still 5' tall. It had a barrel-like torso but not as round.  It had a head and a face, but is face lacked definite features. I immediately knew it didn't belong there and I freaked out.  I yelled at it, and told it that it did not belong there, and that it had better leave. I threatened it with violence.  I was too terrified to run inside and grab my shotgun, so we jumped in the old gmc pickup.  For clarification, I asked my friend 'do you see what I'm seeing?!  I turned to look at him and could only see the back of his head as he was looking out his driver's side window and said 'I don't know , I'm watching these ones over here'. I said let's get the hell outta here! He started up the truck and we high tailed it down the driveway, which turned right along the grassy knoll where I saw the first one. I looked and here is the first one levitating in its Indian style position towards us. It made lurching, lunging actions towards us but never raised any arms or anything; but it's face h! ad turne d into a terrifying metallic scowl.  I was yelling as I watched this thing through the passenger side window.  I told my friend, 'It's after us!  Haul ass!'  He stepped on the gas but the truck kept lurching towards the deep ditch on his side of the road.  It took everything he had to fight the wheel and keep the truck in the road.  This went on for about 300 yards down the road.  We drove fast for another 2 or 3 miles without incident. I told him to stop the truck just to be sure it wasn't a broken tie rod or something.  I inspected under the truck and found nothing wrong. We continued to hwy 299 and finally headed towards Redding.  Strange thing is, by now the sun was coming up as the sky turned from night.  Where did 5 or 6 hours go within a frenzied 5 mile drive down the dirt road through the woods?  The next day my girlfriend accused me if having a hickey on my abdomen just above waste line. I indeed had a mark resembling a birth mark or hickey about an inch wide by two inches long! .  It faded after a few days.  My friend refused to ever talk about that night again.  It was the most terrifying night of my life.  I can't seem to find any other accounts of robotic, levitating, alien beings that seem to teleport themselves to a location.",

     "text":"Object defies physics in Newport Beach, CA The main reason that I'm submitting this UFO sighting report so many years after the incident occurred is that I'm just very curious if there was anybody else that was an eyewitness to what I saw that night, and if so, I would love to hear their descriptions, and compare their perspectives with mine. The following occurred in Newport Beach, California, on a Saturday night/Sunday morning at approximately 2 AM on October 26, 1996:   I was out for a jog, and I was running southward down the beach at  approximately 2 AM between 68th and 56th Streets.  Out of the corner of my left eye I saw several green fireballs falling, which I turned to look at.  They were falling on the north side of Pacific Coast Highway (approximately near what I later learned had been a military airstrip in Costa Mesa that had been used  back in the forties).   The green fireballs were only falling approximately 30 to 50 feet in the air.  I thought it was odd, but I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it, because I was thinking that they could be fireworks or something, and so I kept running.   Because I had just seen the green fireballs, my eyes were alert and able to move quickly to what I saw next, which occurred approximately 30 seconds after I saw the green fireballs.  Out of my upper left peripheral vision, I saw a streak come nearly straight downward like a shooting star, which left a trail in the atmosphere, like the tail of a comet.  At the same instant, I heard it make a slight \"pfft\" sound.   The trail wasn't straight above me, but it was above me, forward, and to my left.  I looked at this trail in the atmosphere in wonderment, and as I was looking, I saw that at the bottom of the trail (where the the head of the comet would be), there was an object, which wasn't going anywhere, but was shaking.  It seemed unstable, and then it started gliding erratically forward and downwards left and right, looking shaky, with motions that looked very much like the motions of a butterfly.  It then stabilized into a smoother glide.   I noticed the object had an orange glow, which I realized must've been caused by friction from the atmosphere, because it obviously entered the atmosphere from outer space at a very high rate of speed, maybe 20,000 to 50,000 miles per hour, and then abruptly came to a dead stop approximately 700 to 1000 feet above me. (a mind blowing maneuver!)  During the time that the object was at the bottom of the \"comet-like tail,\" it was shaking in mid air, so it was hard to see what it's shape was.  It seemed like it could've been a hat shaped UFO, possibly black and silver colored, but as it started gliding it seemed as though it was a different shape.  It seemed like it was more of a Batplane shape or a glider wing; black, but with tinges of an orange glow.   This craft made no sound, though I do have a vague recollection that there may have been a faint sound which could be comparable to the sound of a sailboat's sails being blown by the wind, or the kind of sound that a hang glider might make while flying.  I would attribute the sound to atmospheric friction against the craft, which would mean I must've been fairly close to it in order to hear that, considering the sound of the surf was coming from 50 to 70 feet to the right of me. Estimating how high the craft was and its size is difficult because it was nighttime, and the thing seemed to be changing its shape.  If it was approximately 700 to 1000 feet above me, then I would estimate it to be maybe 30 to 40 feet in diameter. The next description of maneuvers  coincided with the objects gradual shape shifting some more, and becoming circular, or oval shaped, with a milky white color, almost as though there was a cloudy white film forming around the object. At a very high rate of speed, as it was becoming encapsulated in some kind of milky white plasma, it started doing big S shape maneuvers which defied any physics I'd ever experienced.  It whipped around to the right as though it was a tetherball attached to a pole, and then it whipped around to the left in the same way.  The size of these big S shape maneuvers would cover an area the size of 10 to 15 football fields.  It would intermittently stop, but not completely, and it was at these stopping points that its motion had a profound effect on me.  I could sense what its propulsion was based on.   The profound \"big picture\"realization I had was that the object's strange movement, no longer seemed strange when viewed within the context of experiencing gravity and the inertia of myself and the Earth moving together through the cosmos.  To illustrate what I mean, picture yourself in a race car in a race at the Indy 500, and there's another race car in front of yo! u weaving and darting quickly left and right.  In context with you experiencing the speed of your vehicle and seeing the payment moving very very quickly underneath your race car, the motion of that race car in front of you would seem normal.  But the motion of the race car in front of you wouldn't seem normal if you and the race car that you were in were just sitting still while the payment underneath you was also completely still.  When experiencing the UFO object's motion with in the context of Newtonian physics, where in, the earth and I were seemingly standing still, the motions of the UFO looked odd.   But in the context of experiencing the inertia of myself and the Earth moving together through the cosmos, the UFO's motions didn't look odd.  This is more in the realm of quantum physics perhaps, because it's not just the relationship of the UFO's movements with myself in context with the Earths gravity that makes up the equation, but additionally, it's also the inertia of the earth and the inertia and gravitational properties of the s! olar sys tem, and the inertia of the galaxy etc.   The UFO caused me to feel myself traveling at the speed of the earth and even possibly sense the speed of the solar system through the galaxy.  Seeing this UFO helped me to understand that the UFO was using principles of celestial mechanics to propel itself.  Here's another illustration in the form of a riddle/question which I will sometimes ask people in order to get them to start to ponder and grasp the concepts that I was able to realize as a result of having this experience:   Question:  How does a UFO accelerate from 0 miles an hour to 50,000 miles an hour, all in a split second?  Answer:  It puts on the brakes. The S patterns gradually moved away from me Southward and then subsided and turned into a weaving flight like that of of an agile aircraft.  It headed southward toward Laguna Beach and morphed into what looked more like a projection then a physical object, like the projection of a spotlight on a cloud, or a film being projected onto a cloud.   I watched it as it gradually moved further and further away, moving in the direction of Laguna Beach, until it was finally out of site.",

     "text":"Bright sun-illuminated \"dot\" drifting over S.E. Portland, Oregon On 6 July 2007, at approximately 4:40 PM (Pacific Daylight Savings Time)in the afternoon, my wife called me on our house phone (I was upstairs, where I was working as usual at our home-based business), using her cell phone, to say that she say a UFO, and that I had better get out there (where she was: on the back deck) pretty quickly or it would probably no longer be there. I thought she was perhaps joking, as less than a minute or so previously, she had called me to ask me to take a look at the good job she had done constructing a makeshift sun-screen to protect the plants on the deck from the excessive heat and sun.  (The temperature was in the mid 80s, relatively hot for this area; the sun was quite bright). I thought her second call might be a way to get me to show up outside quicker than I might do ordinarily. When I was outside, she pointed into the bright, blue sky, where a quite bright \"dot\" was drifting slowly in the sky, very generally in an S or SE direction.  The \"dot\" appeared to maintain very generally the same apparent altitude.  Although much sunlight was apparently reflected from it, it was difficult to make out any size for the object, as if it were extremely bright but extremely far away or extremely tiny in spite of its brilliance. The object did not appear to vary noticeably in brightness during the time it was observed, which was perhaps a minute by myself, and an additional (preceding) minute by my wife.  The object showed no signed of rotation, or any sort of jerky motion that one might expect e.g. a helium-filled balloon with some sort of attached string to exhibit while being (presumably) buffeted by the wind. The air in the vicinity of our house at this time as not particularly windy, but also not necessarily totally calm. The angle of the line of sight was about 40 degrees, and certainly no more than 45 degrees; the line of sight was essentially parallel to the slope of the roof on the back (SW) portion of the second storey of our house.  The object was seen to be about one half to one inch about the slope o the roof, as estimated via fingers held out at arm's length. In discussing the sighting briefly with my wife, I referred to the object as being exceptionally shiny, although she referred to it as being very white, which I would agree with.  The color of the reflection seemed (to me) to possibly be strongly suggestive of a metallic-type reflection. Seeing the object did not result in any immediately-obvious other-worldly sensations; it seemed unusual to be seeing such an object, and there was some degree of discomfiture in not being able to classify it as to the sort of thing it was, or why it was there, or what it was doing, etc. The sky at the time was generally cloud-free, and certainly in the ESE direction toward which we were looking and where the object was seen. The object appeared to drift in the sky, until it was obscured by the upper leaves of some neighboring trees and then no longer visible. The object drifted perhaps two inches (per at-arm-length finger measurement) during the time it was observed; it was not moving particularly quickly at all.  It was most certainly not stationary, however. Attempts to contact a local (or any) FAA Flight Service Station to obtain information regarding the magnitude and direction of the winds aloft were unsuccessful, as all that was apparently readily accessible over the phone was prerecorded weather information for the vicinity, which gave just the surface winds(?), which (if I noted this correctly) were \"310\" (the heading presumably) at \"12\" (MPH?) for Portland (Oregon), or at \"6\" for Troutdale (Oregon). This report was submitted about 6:40 PM, two hours after the incident.",

     "text":"Irregular black object that changed shape, with smaller object that came and went, seen in daylight. At approximately 1 PM on March 22, 2014 my wife and I were leaving the Mount Vernon, Washington post office.  We had not left the lot when we saw an odd object seemingly hanging motionless in the sky, more or less north of our position. At first we thought it was a helicopter, but on closer examination it appeared to be irregularly shaped, and a solid black.  Although the sun was shining through light haze we saw no reflections off the surface.   We stopped the car and parked again, facing the object, and watched it from both inside and outside the car for about 10 minutes.  During this time the object very slowly moved toward us and a little to the west.  When we left to do other errands it was still there. There was little wind, but it did not move like a balloon, bobbing with air currents, but directionally, for want of a better word.  It continually changed shape, although it never took on any regular shape and always appeared as an irregular polygon.  It could have been rotating but it was hard to tell because of the fully black appearance.  It did appear to be more changing shape than rotating from a subjective perception.  It's hard to imagine a rigid solid shape that could rotate and be all those different appearances. While we watched it I noticed that another smaller irregular black object was nearby and this object would move toward the main one and seem to disappear, and then move away from it again. I pointed this out to my wife and she did see this second object.  After a while I noticed that there was a sort of grey halo of light around the object, perfectly circular, and when I mentioned this to her, she exclaimed, \"I thought I was seeing things! I see it too!\" or something to that effect.   I went outside the car and could see the halo from that position as well, although the glare from haze made it harder. It was impossible to tell how far away it was, but it did seem to be a smaller object that was closer rather than a large object farther away.   My wife did a search on youtube for \"amorphous black ufo\" and found a number of videos that were pretty similar to what we had seen except they didn't have a smaller object that came and went.",

     "text":"three changing color groups of lights hovering over rooftops I was awakened this morning about 5:40 am here in west Houston by my 17 year old daughter who was up early for school. She was sitting eating breakfast and happened to notice a strange light out the back window. She said she watched it, got her sister (15), and witnessed three distinct groups of lights hovering over the rooftops in the distance. They said they could see a dark object in the center of one, but two were just hovering as changing colored lights (at different heights),  That's when they woke me. I ran outside to see and confirmed two of these objects. At an arms length I'd say they were about the size of an aspirin or peanut.  Fairly large and distinct with 4 or 5 lights making up a cross or diamond shape.  The lights were pulsating and changing colors: red, green, blue, white, turquoise.  They were hovering at different heights above the rooftops of the next neighborhood.  One was very low, just barely over the rooftops, the other about twice the height of the homes below. I went in to get my astronomical telescope to see if I could zero in on it. While I was trying to sight it, the one I was watching reduced in size, turned orange and began to move to my right. I followed it around to the front of my house and watched it slowly move parallel to the ground just above the rooftops until it disappeared behind homes. The other light was gone when I looked back. My daughter tried to film it, but could not get it focused due to palm fronds interfering with autofocus. However, you can see the two objects and the colors that they were cycling through. We don't know, of course, what it was, but the two objects I saw were silent. About twenty minutes later I went back outside and saw an aircraft approaching from a different part of the horizon and could clearly hear that it was a helicopter.  So I use that in contrast to the silence of the first sighting. The night sky was clear, but moonless, so it was very dark.",

     "text":"Elongated cigar shape, translucent or transparent, controlled flight, no fuselage I was swimming at Hancock Point Dock, and after a swim, I laid down on the dock on my back. I had sunglasses on; these screened out UV and so I could see quite well. Clouds were at high altitude (cirrus), mostly blue sky and the clouds were scattered. I had been thinking that it would be a good time to spot and observe a UFO, which I am interested in generally. Previously at the dock, I had seen some somewhat unusual things including one craft which looked like a more angular Space Shuttle with no contrail at high altitude going southwest to northeast (that was in a previous month perhaps about May 2007, and it occurred just after the Space Shuttle was launched that day, so I assumed I may have seen the Space Shuttle although it seemed impossible to me at the time). Anyway on this day I was relaxed after swimming and saw a tubular shaped object. This looked like a translucent plastic tube, slightly tapered at both ends. It was proceeding from north to south at high altitude but below the cirrus clouds. I could see that because of its altitude, and because I could see it clearly, it must have been quite large, I would estimate about 30 feet wide or less. It looked like the general shape of straight across airplane wings, but was translucent looking similar to what a bubble or translucent plastic balloon, no color, and could see blue sky through it. Also, there was no fuselage or anything attached. The object moved much like airplane wings, not along its long axis but along the short axis for its direction of travel. It appeared quite stable in its motion and direction. I observed it for a minute or more; and although it did not seem to go behind any clouds, the object disappeared from view while it should have stayed in view. It did not look like any sort of \"floater\" or eye defect like that; it looked like a real object similar to a very high altitude balloon, and it did seem to slightly block out the upper cloud layer above it as it flew between me and the high cloud layer. It was defin! itely be low the cloud layer. Toward the end of the time when I was carefully watching this object, it seemed to waver slightly as if it was slightly shifted by wind, but this variation was very slight, and may have been a result of my own motion or even my imagination comparing the object's motion to the nearby cloud layer. This is really only the second time I felt I saw something unusual. In the early 1960s I saw a green fireball at night, silent, with green particles flying off it, but I had assumed at that time it was some sort of near Earth meteor and nothing very unusual-- (although that was the most phenomenal sighting of anything in my life-- with one friend (we were camping out, and my friend also saw that object). But that was huge; this translucent balloon looking thing was relatively tiny compared to that. There was no sound associated with the elongated balloon thing. One thing I would like to mention about it was that it did not seem random in its motion; rather, it stayed transverse to its flight path at all times as if it was controlled; a balloon would have moved end over end somewhat; this did not do that at all. As I said also it had no fuselage whatsoever, and seemed to have nothing at all other than the elongated translucent plastic looking material, slightly tapered at the ends but not pointed. I was wide awake at the time of the sighting, having just swum in very cold water, and I looked away several times and back at the object to test that it was really there.

     "text":"Midway airport area, sphere or disc hovering and then accelerating rapidly At approx 9:30 a.m., I was driving northbound (inbound to Chicago) on Hwy 55, The Stevenson Expressway, approaching the Harlem Ave exit ramp.  In the sky, perhaps at a 45 degree angle or so from me and apparently at least 1000 feet up or so, I noticed an object.  I would estimate it's location as being directly above the area of 54th Street and Oak Park Avenue, possibly somewhat farther east-southeast.  I noted that it was black and round, not much larger than a BB at arm‚Äôs length.  My first thought was that I was looking at a bird or an airplane end-on, but it quickly became obvious that it was neither.  There was a solid gray cloud cover, the shape of the object was starkly visible, and wings if they existed would be clearly seen.  No plane would be ascending towards or descending away from nearby Midway Airport (about two miles east-southesast of there)so steeply at that altitude. By now I had viewed the object hovering in the sky for about five seconds.  Suddenly it bolted, at a bit of an angle right-to-left, headed roughly eastbound and upward, toward the clouds.  The black circle rapidly shrank into a pinpoint dot and disappeared into the clouds, clearly moving upward and away very fast.  It took less than two seconds for it to accelerate out of sight.  I did not see a hole in the clouds where it entered the solid cloud ceiling.  My impression was that it was disc-shaped because of the flat appearance of the black (no shading at the edges like you'd see with a sphere). The only reason I saw this object is that I had a shocking daylight sighting of a large craft back on November 9, and since then I‚Äôve been scanning the skies every chance I get, hoping to see another UFO, which amazingly enough I did.  These two sightings were very different, however. Truthfully, I‚Äôve been reluctant to post this sighting, as I‚Äôve been discouraged since my previous experience.  Since I was alone at the time, and I'm not a pilot or a police officer, it seems that I might not be qualified enough to report that a gigantic, very clearly defined black rectangle which I observed at length, slowly flying in high-visibility conditions before it camouflaged itself, is not a ‚Äúweather phenomenon‚Äù or some other nonsense like that.  Even though I‚Äôm in my 40s, a stable family man with a science degree, that‚Äôs lived in the Chicago area with it's teeming air traffic basically my whole life, to boot.  Worse still, you feel you can‚Äôt discuss it with anybody, because even your closest friends or family members will think you‚Äôre a nut case or want to come up with some ridiculous debunking.  If I had gotten photographs, those either wouldn‚Äôt have been good enough, or they would have been too good, i.e. fake.  So the whole process of seeing and reporting a sighting is really very frustrating, even though I‚Äôm joined by tens of thousands of other witnesses.",

     "text":"Saw a white flatish oval or cigar shaped white object for 5 seconds and then it disappeared. Clear blue sky with no clouds. This sighting happened to me as nearly as I can recall back about two years ago, during the month of July of 2008. It may have been something like July 15th or so. I was out in my backyard cutting the grass and I sat down to rest a bit on a 3 foot high railroad tie fence at the back of my yard. My back yard has an elevation slope of about 4 degrees which is why I usually need to rest since half of the grass cutting is \"going up hill\". As I looked up to the north, I noticed a white object floating or stationary over the crest of the mountain ridge which, from my back yard is about 1 1/2 miles north of here. I know it's about 1 1/2 miles from here because of the time it takes for the sound to reach me from the annual fireworks displays each year. Although the fireworks originate from an area on the crest of that mountain about a mile west of here, so for the timing of the flash of fireworks to the \"boom\" is about 9 seconds, but since where I saw the \"UFO\" is a shorter distance, so I approximate it to be about 1 1/2 miles (7 to 8 seconds). I put the shape of the object in your form as \"cigar shaped\" although that's not exactly it's correct shape. I'm a former technical illustrator and since I smoke cigars I'm well aware of the fact that cigar shape doesn't exactly describe it perfectly. The upper and lower sides weren't exactly parallel as in most cigars, but slightly convex - very slightly. And each end of the craft was round, not like in most cigars which are round on one end and the lighting end is flat or just cut straight off. But anyway, that's the best I can describe it verbally, but with drawing it I could draw it exactly as it was. The craft was just white, not shiny metallic like an aluminum aircraft.  Also the craft wasn't blindingly emitting a strong source of light, it was just white like a white object.  One thing that I noticed was that there didn't seem to be any shadow on the underside of the craft,  It was just all white. I took about 1 second to adjust my eyeglasses and then when looking back at it, it just wasn't there anymore. Now I'm 74 years old and have been wearing eyeglasses for about 65 years so I'm well aware of whether or not it was a white piece of fluff or object on my eyeglasses.  The craft I saw I clearly focused on. It wasn't an object on my eyeglasses.  I know the difference after 65 years.  I was a member of the USAF for 4 years and also have my Private Pilot's Certificate so am used to viewing object in the sky. So when I looked back to the object after first seeing it  for about 5 seconds it was just wasn't there anymore. My theory as to why it wasn't there anymore is that either:   1 - It zoomed away in that time, or else,  2 - It just became invisible in that time. Incidentally, I know clouds can disappear in only a few seconds, like about  5 seconds at times, but this object disappeared in only one second.  I know that in film clips on TV that clouds seem to disappear in only maybe about 1 second, but that's only in time lapse filming.  This object disappeared in real time in only 1 second. So, there you have it. Every time I go out to cut the grass now, I always keep an eye on the sky here but haven't  seen that object anymore.  I keep looking but so far, no luck.

     "text":"Bright Lights on the High-Line Well this sighting time is not exact, as this even has occurred spuratically over a few years after a first sighting caught my attention and sparked my hightened awareness to the lights that surrounded me in my rural montana sky. At the times of these sightings i ranged in age of 17-19 years old. If there is any doubt as to my credibility, i assure you i have nothing to gain from wasting my time with a false report. I am however completely astonished to see that other people in Havre, MT have had VERY similar accounts on dates that i very well could have been seeing the same thing! So i apologize that the dates are not accurate, but the account however is most definately accurate, as i can best recount.  The most vivid memory i have of these fireballs was not my first, but i must however tell the story of the first sighting of these so called fireball or bright light. So it happened that me and my very best friend, who is also witness to this and a few other sightings, were driving northeast on what would be an unmapped dirt road on a state map, but the locals all know this as a network of back roads connecting local amish (hudderites) communities and leading to the highway that goes to canada. So here we are driving on this dirt road, staring at the stars above and smoking like chimneys just enjoying the company, when we decided we had better turn around as this dirt road goes forever, and we didnt intend on going the full route. Upon turning around and driving for sometime we approached over a hill and i noticed something i definately didnt see going the other way. Now over this hill the landscape evened out, as is common in the hilly area of havre, and i asked my friend if she saw it, and what she thought of it. Open minded as we are, we speculated that it must be a light up on a pole on someones farm. Still stopped we stared for some time at it, it was noticeably brighter and more orange than a streetlamp, or a light on a pole at someones farm might be, just a little fireball with consistent edges that didnt move. However upon careful consideration this light had to be up higher than any light on a pole could be, and way too low to be a star, and too bright for that matter, and too orange. That kind of gave me the creeps, especially that it was hovering in the southern sky, same direction as where i live, and the road i got to travel home alone on. The both of us would recount this story nearly the same, storytelling ability aside, i have given my best memorial account of this event....which led to many other sightings of exactley the same object, and this most noteable one i will share with you next.   At the time of the first sighting, it  must have been early before winter, as it was cold, or i would have got out, and before there was snow on the ground. However i clearly remember this most memorable sightings season, as there was plenty of snow, and everything was white, making a nice white horizon off in the distance where the hills rolled off into the beaver creek park. This time me and my best friend, again at night, anywhere between 9pm-12am, were traveling on this dirt route forementioned in my previous account, i noticed there were three lights off in the distance, and in the same area as the previous sights to a tee, now i had seen three lights before in a straight line formation, however they never moved. Now this time me and my friend were already stopped when we both realized the lights at the same time, they were going to dance for us. One, two, three lights spaced evenly apart all jumped up, leaving a tail that dissipated, to a higher location, and jumped then to a lower location, that was lower than where they were at initial sighting, this happened rather quickly, the jumps taking about 3 seconds a piece. After each jump the lights would all disappear and then reappear, it was like as the tail faded so did the light. It was a pattern obviously. Appear, jump leaving a tail, disappear, reappear in new location. In that order. Now as they are appearing and reappearing and whatnot, im telling my friend to flash the car lights at them, like maybe we could get a response. To no avail, but it was worth a shot, in my opinion they were obvlivious to us. They did eventually blink out, they did not appear to travel away, as in get further away then closer, they stayed at the same distance away from us.   Now i grew up in Havre and was always fascinated by its bright sky with so much going on in it, and it was all visible. Over the years there are certain things you see all the time. Sattelites, jets, planets that are brighter on certain days, meteor showers, every cosmic even that goes on in our horizon is visible to us, because thats the beauty of Montana. I say this so that i can distinguish to you that i have the common knowledge to differentiate between something explainable to us, and something that is not. These fireballs are to me one of many things, one is it is possible alien spacecraft, manned, or unmanned, who knows. It could be military training, or military related, as there are Nuclear bombs all along the hi-line from what i hear, not sure if any in the immediate Havre proximity, but theres alot of land out there, and i know of one you can see on the way to great falls. What if those lights are what cause crop circles? I was always interested to know weather or not the local farmers ever had one appear. What if this is actually a craft lifting off or studying something. It could be one craft or many crafts. If its one craft it would have to be a very bright, small craft. If it is one, then it would have to be dark and those would have to be its lights, but im only speculating at this point, relaying what goes through my mind when i recount this memory.  Now i hope this helps other locals out there, and i encourage all to share theyre stories of weird lights over montana. What a perfect place to see a UFO, so clear and so much unused land. Just like new mexico and nevada, there is alot of unused land. Could the government be using it? Speculating again, ahh what can i say to a wandering mind when it comes to matters like this. Thanks all for listening. -Smartone",

I always take time to scan the skies while outside after dark. Sometimes I take my night vision scope out because there are so many more stars and other objects that are seen with the night vision monocular than with the naked eye. Last night I took the scope outside with me again. I was able to see, what I believe were, two separate satellites traversing the night sky. These are usually always seen at least once a night through the scope. However, after looking at the sky for a good 10 minutes I was able to see an object that I could not identify. This object was traveling from west to east very high up. Because it was only visible through the night vision I could not discern if this object was within the earth‚Äôs atmosphere or if it was out in space. This object moved much slower than the satellites I see every night, much slower. It also brightened and dimmed in a rhythmic pattern. While the object moved through the sky it would slowly brighten, stay bright for about a second and then slowly dim again to nearly invisible, staying dim for approximately 4-5 seconds. This pattern repeated itself during the length of time I watched the object. It didn‚Äôt flash quickly or erratically, nor did it move briskly or erratically. This object stayed on the same course repeating it‚Äôs brightening and dimming as it went. When the object was at its dimmest, it blended in with the smaller, less visible stars in the sky. The size and shape of it was very much like the rest of the stars. I was not at all able to see this object without the use of the scope, even when it brightened to its maximum luminosity. Eventually, this object flew out of sight. Given the slow movement, size and the fact the object was not visible without the scope, I believe this object to have been in space. If it was, it had to have been extremely large!  There were other aircraft in the sky during this sighting. I could hear and see an airliner coming from TIA in Tampa heading north and see smaller aircraft to the west heading south. These planes were much lower and faster than the craft I was watching. I am a paranormal investigator and have some experience in investigating and reporting unexplained events. I have seen satellites, the ISS, shooting stars and all kinds of aircraft as I have served in the USAF and currently reside in an airplane community; this object did not fit the description of any of these things. If anyone knows what this thing could have been or also saw it, I‚Äôd love to know! This sighting really surprised and excited me.",

     "text":"Stargazing at 3am... We were not supposed to see this... My boyfriend and I spend our weekends in a very rural part of Virginia working on his 15 acre undeveloped property he bought last year.  At 3am I stepped outside for a cigarette and walked towards the end of the driveway.  I was drawn because I noticed that there were an unusual number and arrangement of stars in the sky.  There were too many of them to begin with, they were bright and they FILLED the northern sky.  As I stood there I saw that many were not stationary.  In college I took physics of the universe and realize that stars can have a slight wobble; however, these objects were clearly moving closer‚Ä¶  I stood there transfixed until finally I went to get my boyfriend.  He was not too thrilled to be urged out into the freezing cold at 3am, but obliged. We stood at the end of the driveway and tried to take a video, but because there is not a street light nor neighbor within close proximity we were only able to capture our commentary.  The  objects were spinning, moving erratically, stopping and darting and changing colors.   We noticed one extremely low in altitude to our left.  We hopped in the car and dialed 911 as the sight we felt should be seen by someone in law enforcement, if only to give more credit to what we were seeing.  The operator sounded completely annoyed as I tried to convey the magnitude of what we were witnessing.  When we found a field, we pulled over and parked.  We were encircled by flying objects in the sky.  One with red X's and white lights circling its perimeter flew across the sky at a faster rate than others.  The smaller ones formed spiral/circular patterns overhead. I used a flashlight to 'communicate.' I wasn't sure what I would accomplish, but I didn't feel scared or threatened.  I think it coaxed the objects to come even closer. We had one overhead that had a green light on the underbelly.  There was an SUV that I think must have seen everything as the driver stopped on the road by the field and then sped off.  This is why I listed the witnesses as 3.  What we saw was undeniably the most surreal and bewildering experiences I have ever had. We drove to a 24 hour gas station and then onto another field where we witnessed more of the same and a larger, triangular shaped object with white lights on the corner which tilted and flashed in the middle where two smaller objects circled each other.  We watched these objects overhead until the sun rose.  It was absolutely the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I have no other explanation other than alien craft.  What I saw could not have been driven by or made by human hands.",

I was driving home from work on Sugarloaf Parkway between Lawrenceville Hwy. and Five Forks Trickum at approximately 10:10pm.  I saw a craft flying lower than normal (not as low as the tree line, but not as high as a small plane would fly).  It seemed to be flying slower than would be possible for a plane, so it caught my attention.  Then I noticed it had two flashing white lights and then two flashing red lights in sort of a cross or square pattern.  I figured it was a small plane because of the flashing lights, but the fact that it was so low to the ground and was moving so slowly kept my attention.  I kept my eye on it as much as possible as I drove down the road and it seemed as if it changed directions (like it made a sharp right turn), so I thought it was either a helicopter or a trick of the eye as I was driving. I lost sight of it, but then when I arrived at my home (less than five minutes later) I saw the object again directly over me (which was odd since it was now flying in the complete opposite direction of when I last saw it).  I was out of the car, standing still and it was moving very slowly overhead.  We are directly beneath the regular flight path of jets heading toward Atlanta airport, so I'm very familiar with jet traffic in the area (which are much higher in the sky, but I can still hear them powering down as they prepare to land at Hartsfield, about 40 miles south).  At the same time the object was flying over me going north, a regular jet was flying overhead south toward Atlanta and I could clearly hear it.  In less than a minute the jet was completely gone and I could not hear it anymore, however, the lower object was still slowly flying over me, and that's when I realized that the lower object was not making any noise (so it was clearly not a plane or a helicopter). ! It made its way over the tree line and was gone. I stayed out waiting to see if it would come back for another hour, but it didn't.  However, a small plane did fly overhead (because I am near a small local airport) and I could clearly hear that it was a plane and it gave me a good reference for what altitude the small planes in the area fly.  The object I saw was definitely much lower than that plane.  I want to say that it was a box shape, but I'm only basing that on the fact that the two white lights and two red lights were at four corners, but they almost appeared to be on one flat side rather than around an object.  The two white lights flashed together and the two red lights flashed together.  So, I can't really say what shape it was, maybe flat, maybe square, maybe diamond shaped.  It seemed more like it was meandering along quietly rather than hovering.  Almost like it was making a sweep of the area.  I tried to take a video of it with my phone, but I only got it for a second, so you can't really see anything.  I do! n't know what it was, but it was definitely unusual and I would be interested if anyone else has seen anything similar in the area.

Dear Mr.Davenport or staff, I am reporting this sighting again because I have a feeling you all don't believe me or think its a hoax.  Forgive me if it was a backlog issue.  I re edited my own report to shorten it up a bit.  I am in my middle ages and I pretty much know what belongs in the sky and what is not the norm.  I am also a ametuer astronomer.I ask you please to delete my report and all data pertaining to me if your not going to use this report.  I would testify under oath in a court of law that all I have said is true if I had too.I wished others had reported craft from Tulsa that night to back up my sighting. Thank you sincerely,  ((name deleted)). August 2 2008 East Tulsa Oklahoma  11:45 pm  While laying down studying stars and constellation's with binoculars,I noticed with my bare eyes to the east of me at about 80 degrees, 600 to 800 feet high, a craft traveling at high speed, flying from south to north before loosing site of it. My eyes were well adjusted to the dark since I was already studying the stars.The sighting lasted 10 seconds.Five with bare eyes and about five with binoculars. It was brownish red/amber in color and shape was oval- teardrop.It had some sort of membrane/aura around it.Amazingly I already had my binoculars in my hands,the timing was incredible!I zoomed in on it up close,it was squared off in the front like bay windows yet rounded as it tapered towards the back.The very back was rectangle in  shape, totally silent, stayed at constant speed, no lights at all.No way was it a balloon, it was a dead air night no wind whatsoever and the sky was clear.Left no smoke/con trail.When observed through binoculars the membrane was transparent,and oval in shape.I could see through the haze but the \"teardrop\" shaped craft was solid,defenantly mechanical in shape. It was traveling too fast on a horizontal heading to be a weird looking balloon.It was not a plane, as close as it was I would have heard the engines, This craft was silent.I would guess the size at 30x20x5'.I honestly can say now that I have seen something in the sky that I can not explain!It was not a satellite,plane,hang glider, balloon,jet,dirigible,shooting star,ISS or helicopter.I have seen many satellites and meteor's,we live in a City with a International Airport so I have seen all kinds of aircraft including military aircraft.It truly was a UFO by its very definition!

     "text":"Unidentified object and 2 jets I observed something unusual at 10.28 p.m. on March 17, 2015. I used to live in the UK near USAF Upper Heyford in the early ‚Äô80‚Äôs and am quite familiar with different types of aircraft in the night sky.  I also spend time star-gazing so can tell a satellite from a meteor or meteoroid, the space station from a jet, have seen comets, planets, as well as other man-made objects such as Chinese lanterns, Iridium flares, etc. The sky was very clear but no moon and there was supposedly a chance of seeing the Aurora Borealis, which is always a treat in central Pennsylvania, although I am also familiar with this phenomenon having lived for several years in Canada.   I saw no sign of the aurora but while facing west with my house behind me I noticed an object come over the house, heading east to west.  I could not discern its altitude or size but it was high, certainly not a low-flying object.  It appeared in the sky to be the size of a dime (I know that‚Äôs of no help in ascertaining actual size but that‚Äôs how much of the sky it seemed to cover).   It was the shape of a squat comet, perfectly round at the front with a stubby tail.  It was an electric green and emitted light as if it were phosphorescing.  It was not very bright but clearly visible.  I got the impression that I wasn‚Äôt actually seeing the object but rather the result of an object interacting with the atmosphere.  If a disc shaped object were to go through the charged particles that cause the northern lights, this is how I would imagine it would look; I speculate, but I had the distinct impression of there being a disc.  There were no navigation lights evident, and no noise. I watched the ‚Äòthing‚Äô for a couple of seconds (long enough for me to lean forward, peer, and ask myself ‚Äòwhat the hell is that?‚Äô).  It did not shoot across the sky like a meteor.  The speed was more studied, more restrained, I dare say more mechanical.  I was able to view about 60% of the sky before the roof blocked out the rest, and I estimate 10 seconds passed between its appearance and my losing site of it.  Altitude seemed constant and it did not alter its path; I observed no maneuvering. What happened next is why I‚Äôm reporting this.  A jet came in from the south moving north at high speed, navigation lights were observed, no engine sound yet discerned.  It was south of the object and altered its course to come in behind it and generally follow it.  I could hear the jet engine now.  I say generally because it was heading slightly more to the north and I remember thinking that the pilot must have lost contact.  By that time the object was barely visible heading away from me.  Then a light came from where the jet and the object were and arced towards the ground.  It was a bright small white light, with a hint of yellow, and to guess, I would say a flare, no way of telling whether it came from the object or the jet.  I lost sight of both.   Right then a second jet came towards me from the west, it had to have been a different jet as in my estimation there wasn‚Äôt time for a 180-degree maneuver. It went overhead and passed over my house and on to the east at high speed.  I‚Äôm quite sure this was a military craft.  It seemed that the two jets had come at the object from opposite angles of attack; I'm not sure how apt a euphemism that is ... The whole thing left me a bit shaken and I had the urge to get back inside, which is what I did.  I made immediate note of the time on my cell phone that I had left in the kitchen (it read 10.30 p.m. so my best guess at time of observation was as I stated initially, 10:28 p.m.).  I told my story to my wife and drew a sketch of what had occurred.   There is no doubt in my mind that the aircraft were interacting with whatever it was that I saw.",

Just got home from a late night at the casino.  Quickly checked e-mails and prepared to go to bed.  Still dark outside with no indication of sun rising yet.  I turned off my bedroom light and laid down on the bed, just before I closed my eyes, I saw a light in the sky.  My bed is right beside the window which faces east.  I have no curtains, and I live on the 17th floor of an apartment building.  Mind you, I filed a report one month ago.  I have to admit I have a more heightened awarness of the night sky now.   The view from my bedroom allows me to see the entire eastern night sky.  To redirect attention for a second, other than the last report I filed in Late January, I have had to other sightings, one in grade eight, and the other sometime in late highschool.   My first sighting was at a religious retreat in Orangeville, Ontario (1987).   All the boys slept in a large room with rows of beds either facing toward the inside wall or the outside window.  My bed was facing the large lengthy window.  It was approximately half an hour after the lights had been turned off (10 pm).  I noticed a green glowing, saucer shaped object hovering above the tree line approximately 300 meters away.  There was quite a bit of fog.   I watched it for a few seconds when I saw a beam of green light go down into the trees, that is when I woke everyone up to look at it.  Most were asleep.  Of the 25 classmates in the room, approximately five others witnessed it.   After about a minute, the green glowing object slowly disapated.   The second sighting occured while drving northbound on highway 404 heading toward Richmond Hill, a small town north of Toronto.  This occured sometime in 1993.   I was in the back, left seat of a friends car.  It was the middle of the day.  I looked up and saw a clearly orange triangular shaped object maybe 1 km high.  I pointed it out to my friends, but because of there position, they could not see it.  The driver had to focus on the road, as well.   It hovered for 30 seconds then shot directly st! raight u p at an astonishing speed and disappeared out of site. Now back to the latest sighting.  I quickly determined the light I was looking at was not a plane.  There were no flashing lights, and the light was almost luminescent.  The best I could describe it, as if it was floating across the sky.  The light was approximately a km in the sky.  I stood on my bed and watched the light, it quickly sped away at an alarming speed.   At this point I was convinced it was not a plane.  From the vantage point of my bedroom window, planes normally take approximatel 10 minutes to completely disappear out of sight.  This object not only sped away in less than thirty seconds, it followed an angle in the sky different from an airplane.  Airplanes follow a logical direction in the sky and approach the horizon at a slow and steady speed.   This object reached 'horizon level' in under 30 seconds.  Fighter planes could possibly move at those speeds, but this happened 5:45 in the morning with no sonic boom to be heard.

Before the light disappeared behind the tree line, we noticed another seemly white light appear flying from the east toward this light.  When the two lights were close to each other, the original light quickly became dim-to-invisible, while the other light seemed to become two lights, flashed in an alternating pattern, became dim-to-invisible also.  We were initially aware of this because we live near a major airport; so flying craft from commercial aircraft to recreational aircraft are seen regularly.  This one was strange because it came from a place in the sky outside the flight path that aircraft would normally approach. The above is an observation of something we normally do not see over the skies of this part of New Jersey.  Its behavior was suspicious so we wanted to put it on record.  Thanks for listening.",

     "text":"Daytime Sighting in Maple Grove Hi, I am writing in about an incident that my wife and I witnessed today while driving home to Maple Grove from downtown Minneapolis this afternoon.  We are wondering if anyone else reported this. We were traveling on West 694 about 2 miles out from the 94 interchange when we spotted a large round object over Maple Grove.  It looked to be the area of Rush Creek golf course.  At first I thought it to be a Hot Air Balloon but the closer we got the farther west it moved at incredible speed. (This when things got bizarre)  We turned onto the 94 exit and then instantly turned off onto the Weaver Lake Rd Exit and came up to a red light. While waiting along with a number of other vehicles we could see the large round object (with no distinct features) had turned and traveled back east about 5 to 10 miles in less than a minute and was hovering over Boston Scientific complex, about a ¬º mile to a ¬Ω mile WNW clearly in view. We were watching this in amazement when out of nowhere (right in fron! t of us) a large Black unmarked Military style helicopter shows up and approaches the object. Right as this is happening we got the green and turned left onto Weaver Lake Rd. We made the left turn and noticed the Helicopter had veered off to the right of the object. Thinking as soon as we get to the top of the hill (not even a ¬º of a mile) the object is going to be right there in front of us. The object had completely vanished. We traveled about a ¬º of a mile down the road and could see it had traveled west about 5 miles in less than a minute. My next thought was it seemed to be over Rush Creek Elementary. I drove up to the school and had a great view for a long ways west. We saw the object but it had traveled as far west as we could see about another 5-10 miles. I proceeded to drive north on 101 until I got to County Rd 30 and took a left. And it just may be coincidence, but right after we made the turn there was a trooper sitting off the side of the road. We did see the o! bject again, but it was so far away there was no way we were g! oing to get close to it. A few facts here; No Hot air Balloon is going to travel 5-10 miles west and turn around and return east the same distance if not more in the matter of a minute or less. There were a lot of people that saw this. Anyone traveling on west 694 at this time of day saw this. Hot air balloons can‚Äôt travel distances this thing did. This thing could travel 5 to 10 miles in less than a minute. I called the police department at 7:30 to see if anyone reported anything on this but the dispatcher said she just started working at 5:00 and had not heard anything. This report was also filed with MUFON on the day it happened. We are meeting with an MUFON investigator on Saturday morning to try and recreate everything we saw.",

     "text":"white fluorescent light color/dark circle in center/spherical shape/glimpse of it leaving orbit vanished leaving 2 lights behind it I was taking my pet out for a nighttime walk when I looked up at the sky for a moment. About a good 5-10 seconds I was looking up at the sky, I saw a flying object with white fluorescent coloring flying upward toward the sky. It was difficult to make out the shape of it due to a poor perspective. I caught it (from my angle) coming out from behind a house (though i'm sure it was much further away) and I have a hunch I caught a glimpse of it JUST as it was leaving the planet. I saw it for maybe just about one second traveling at a miraculous speed (for an object so far away) before it disappeared. After it disappeared it left two lines of light behind it that vanished after about 2 seconds. All I could make out was that from my angle it looked like a round ring shaped craft with a black dark spot in the center of it, so I guess you'd define that as a spherical or circle-like object. Also, there was no sound being emitted from this object. At first I thought it! was just the moon, but then I looked around and realized that from the direction I was standing, the moon was 90 degrees to my left. So NO it wasn't the moon.",

I have an amazing view of the city from my balcony; I can clearly see the airport. Often, I sit and look out while smoking a cigarette. The past few nights I have witnessed a strange light. At first, I thought it was just a star. The longer I looked at it, the more details I could see. It almost seems shaped like the symbol from the Blair Witch films (best way to describe it). It's a cross with ends pointing out in different directions. Two red lights can be seen circling around it at times. It appears in the same general location of the sky almost every night. It seems to move at a painfully slow pace.  It just hovers for a long time. I check back on it every few minutes and it has barely moved from view behind a large tree outside my apartment. The even stranger thing is that very small looking planes seems to fly right past it constantly.  These are tiny red lights that flash quickly and fly fast.  One night it seemed like two of them were harnessed together and then the one in the back just dropped from the sky and vanished. Tonight my strange star in the sky, slowly shrunk until it was almost invisible to me.  It was strange because at first I thought a cloud had passed in front of it (though I believe it may be too low in the sky for that).  But it just appeared to get more and more hazy until it was just a pin prick of what it once was. So, I have no idea what to call this thing that appears here nightly.  I'm beginning to be a bit freaked out, though.  I urged my boyfriend to look at it.  While he had no explanation for what it was, he didn't seem nearly as intrigued as me.",

     "text":"Translucent Spherical object Motionless in sky for extended period As I was finishing my lunchtime workout at the Salvador Perez Fitness Center about 13:50 MDT, a couple of the fitness center staff and another gentleman were visible outside through the window, staring up at the sky. When one of them came back inside, a woman working out near me asked him what they were looking at. He said ‚Äúthat UFO that‚Äôs just hanging up there!‚Äù She and I both immediately went outside to look.  We saw, about 30 degrees from the horizon, a spherical object hovering motionless over SSE Santa Fe. It had the transparent appearance of a soap bubble, and was about 1/8  the size of my thumbnail held at arm‚Äôs length.  The woman who walked out with me instantly cried ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a weather balloon!‚Äù, and went back inside, cursing the staff person for a fool. And it may well have been a weather balloon, I don‚Äôt know where to look up stuff like who‚Äôs lofting weather balloons, where and when. I‚Äôm hoping you guys can do that.  Her conviction convinced me for the moment, and I went back inside to shower and change.  However the object was still there when I came out to go back to work, and it had not  moved in the slightest, for at least 15 minutes or more.  I carry a pair of inexpensive 2x8 opera glasses with me in my truck for observing wildlife. Using those, I got a better look at it, and it was perfectly spherical, not the teardrop shape I associate with weather balloons, nor was there any observable gondola or dependent payload hanging beneath the object, nor any visible tether that could explain its complete lack of motion. It was a calm day, but one would think there would be some breeze at the apparent height of the object, which seemed to be about 500 to 1000 feet.  The object remained in place all the way back to work, and was still there when I went inside my building, approximately 20 minutes after I first went to look.",

It was to be seen in the ENE at 39 degrees elecation, starting at 22:06:06. The distance of the flare center from my location was 2.7 km.  The flare (a reflection of the sun) came right on time, but because my eyes were fixed on a spot a little higher up and a little further north, I missed the beginning of the flare. I did catch it in the corner of my eye and looked directly at it when it was at its brightest. The flare was quite spectacular but it faded quickly. The duration of the flare was no more than 2 to 3 seconds.  Less than 2 seconds after the flare had faded from view, a bright and very fast moving light came from the north, heading south. It flew horizontally less than 5 degrees below where the flare had been. I saw the moving light first in that location and followed it until it was obscured by a tree. The entire event lasted no more than 2 seconds.  The object (light) had the general appearance of a meteor but it looked like no meteor I had ever seen and I have seen my share of them. Besides, meteors do not fly parallel to the ground. The head was about the diameter of three Jupiters (or about 2 arc minutes in angular size. The front was convex and the back was concave. Two very  thin \"streamers\" came off the end points on the concave end. The color of the light was white with a yellowish tint. It remained steady in intensity over the brief duration.  I estimated the angular distance between the location of the Iridium flare (and the appearance of the object) and where the tree blocked the object as about 45 degrees. The object traversed that distance in 1.5 seconds. These facts give the object an angular speed of 30 degrees per second. That it ten times faster than the Space Shuttle flying over CA for a landing in FL, and 60 times faster than the angular speed of the ISS (International Space Station) when it passes overhead.  The brief duration of my observation leaves me with the impression that the object was not at a very high altitude, although I have no facts to support that impression. If the object was as low as 10 000 feet, my calculations show that it flew at a speed of 1.26 miles/second, or more than 4500 miles/hour. If it was at any higher altitude, its speed would have been proportionately faster.  Then there is the element of coincidence that I find difficult to accept. How can two visually spectacular but otherwise totally unrelated events occur in the same patch of sky at essentially the same time. What are the odd??  What did I see. Can someone enlighten me?",

Light weight boots were noticed on its feet. The ears and nose appeared normal for a humanoid. The head was slighly larger in proportion to the thorax than would be normal yet was attractive in its shape. Dark brown hair covered the top and back giving it a receeding hairline appearence. We encounterd this personas we were leaving the rocky summit of this Mountain. There are only two trails that leave the summit and our backs were between the subject and the trail head. We had no prior warning of his approach to us and seemed to appear out of nowheare. He greeted us by asking the question, \"What can you tell me about the flora and fauna here.\" I asked him to clairify what he wanted to know. \" I want to know if there are Bears here and are they dangerous.\" I informed him that here are small Black Bears here but they are not aggressive towards humans in general. He responded, \"Very good\". His voice was normal sounding with no accent. He stuck us both to be a college professor or scientists in his questioning but had such a gross lack of basic knowledge about the woods that we both turned in surprise to talk about this person, made eye contact  and then turned quickly back to talk more with him and he was gone.  There was no possible way that he could have gotten out of sight of us so quickly as there is a very limited amount of room on the rock we were standing and it led directly to the trail behind him. In any event we ran around the top of the summit looking for him and then ran down the trail perhaps a quarter mile looking for him. We saw no sign of him. We existed the summit via the other trail and walked rapidly in hopes of findi! ng him t here but did not.  What seemed so strange about this encounter was that it took place on a very cool fall day, perhaps 40 degrees F.  He was dressed for summer and seemed perfectly comfortable.   I not sure this officially qualifies for a close encounter of the third kind but I find it curious that this encounter has stayed so fresh in both of our minds 25 years later.  He and I talk little as we live 2300 miles apart but when we do speak the first thing we say is \"did you see what I saw.\"  The answer continues to be \"yes.\"",

     "text":"Oblong shaped, silent, moved quickly across the sky and was glowing like pink beach glass. At 21:20 I was on the back deck of our house calling the dogs in.  I watched an object move from the SSW sky to NNE.  It was clear night with no clouds. It took approximately 5 to 6 seconds to entirely cross the sky.  It was silent.  It was shaped like a short grain of rice.  It was the color of light pink beach glass softly glowing from within, and with a slight aura of white around it.  If I held my hand at arm‚Äôs length with a short grain of rice, this is about how large it appeared. I called for my husband to come, but it had already disappeared behind the trees.  3 to 4 minutes after observing the object, a commercial airliner crossed the sky from SW to NW on an approach path to Seatac Airport.  I am reporting this with the hopes that perhaps the commercial airliner saw something, or traffic control at Seatac. My husband is a fixed wing and helicopter Pilot.  I grew up around Seatac airport and McChord Air Force base.  I am very familiar with the appearance and flight patterns of conventional aircraft.  I also grew up watching for satellites and am familiar with satellite flight paths across the sky. This pink, slightly oblong object was very unique; like glowing pink glass. It needs be said that in my life I have seen alleged UFOs.  As a 10-year old (1966) my entire family (7 of us) watched an object above the desert in Utah.  It was composed of two large metallic objects with 7 small metallic objects in between the two larger ones.  We all watched it for over 20 minutes. While camping at Mt. Rainier in 1984 I and my children (7 and 4 at the time) watched as a blinking object flew a path ascending toward the mountain before suddenly streaking out of sight. Here in Shelton, I have experienced several occasions of a very bright flash in the night sky.  Sometimes it is one bright flash.  Sometimes it is a series of erratically timed bright flashes.  The flashes are always in one stationary spot in the sky and are not accompanied by any visual trajectory common to a helicopter or aircraft turning or flying; just very bright white flashes, and then nothing. This last Sunday, December 7th, 2008 at 16:43 I observed a very bright white light sitting stationary in the SSW sky above the tree line.  At first I thought it was the first star of the night, however, no other stars were visible and this light was brighter than any star or planet I am accustomed to observing.  I am also aware of metal objects commonly reflecting sunlight at that time of the day in the SW and W sky.  This bright light sat stationary for 10 minutes.  I had my husband get his detachable rifle scope with a high power telephoto capacity.  I propped it on the back of a chair and we watched the bright light.  It never changed position.  It suddenly just disappeared as I was viewing it. I hesitated in turning in my reports because I understand that in order to substantiate anything or lend credibility, it is best triangulated or viewed by more than one person at one place in time.  I was also concerned I‚Äôd come across like a quack because I have seen objects before.  I support all research and work being done in the field of extraterrestrial existence, however, and believe it is important to move forward and turn in a report when it happens with the hopes maybe someone else saw the same thing. I turned in the flashing light reports to MUFON, but the local investigator for MUFON in Olympia has a very jealous wife who felt uncomfortable with him talking to women (even though I am happily married and have no interest in playing around).  He began taking report my report from me but abruptly stopped telling me his wife was jealous of me.  !!??  That was just a weird extraneous experience but it effected how eager I was to turn in any report to MUFON.",

It was clearly capsule-shaped, (or rectangular with rounded edges) never blurred or faded, but seemed to be glowing from above. It was light bluish-green (more on the green side) and seemed like it was not too far up. It did not seem like it was in space. It looked clear or crisp like it was just over the valley. It was much faster than a plane, but not as fast as a shooting star or meteor, at least none that I have seen before. I was so sure that it was a close object that I was expecting a big crash or explosion or something after I couldn't see it anymore.

     "text":"Chevron shaped object suspended over trees in Cary, NC. I am a male nearing retirement age.  I have lived decades in Raleigh, but I grew up in Cary, NC.  I attended NC State University ‚Äì receiving bachelor‚Äôs degrees in Business Management, Economics, and Computer Science.  I write software for retailers as a profession.  Tonight, Saturday, November 30, 2019, I witnessed what seemed to be a UFO over Cary, NC. At about 6:45 pm, it was raining as I was leaving my in-laws home.  I headed North East on Kildaire Farm Road, and I was approaching the intersection of Cary Parkway.  Traffic was modest and slightly slower than usual.  As I approached the traffic light, it turned red, and I began to brake.  Because I looked at the traffic light, I noticed what appeared to be a commercial jet above and beyond the traffic light.  I nitially, I simply thought it was an airplane, and I forced myself to concentrate on the intersection and traffic light until I stopped for the traffic light. I then realized that what I saw did not make sense because commercial airlines do not fly that low over cities, and nothing that large could fly that slowly.  It looked like the underside of a jet wing.  However, it was huge, but it was initially difficult to judge the height ‚Äì even though it appeared to be moving very slowly.  The slow speed resembled a blimp over a football game. I speculated that at that speed, it must be something like a blimp that was covering the NC State vs UNC football game at Carter Finley stadium.  However, it looked nothing like one, and it did not seem possible that a drone could be flying at night when it was raining that hard. The sky appeared to be a very faint light gray color ‚Äì not black yet, and tree lines were not visible. With only a few exceptions (like the traffic light), the night was like a black and white TV show ‚Äì no reds, greens, blues, or yellows. This was the heaviest part of the rainstorm and because of the rain, my windows were ‚Äúrolled‚Äù up. I could see maybe ten lights on the underside of a ‚Äúwing(?)‚Äù One or more may have been blinking, but if so, not with the usual intensity of an airplane light. My focus was on lights that were not blinking. They seemed to have the intensity of a 60-watt incandescent outdoor house light when viewed from the street. The lights retained their distance from each other and moved synchronously. I studied them carefully for hints that this was projected from a source on the ground ‚Äì such as light on raindrops or objects at different heights like buildings, trees, etc., but there was no ‚Äúoverspray‚Äù of light. There was a faint glow around the lights ‚Äì making them appear to illuminate a modest amount of the underside of the ‚Äúwing‚Äù that the lights were mounted on. Without a visual frame a reference for something like this, it was challenging to estimate the height, but it appeared to be hundreds of feet high ‚Äì not thousands. Obviously, it was higher than the trees, but not by a lot. I never saw anything that resembled an airplane body. It was either obscured from view or there was not one. It may have been shaped like a chevron/B-2 bomber (but a much lighter color). The object appeared as if it may have been heading in my direction (i.e. away from the airport), and it was in the process of making a slow, left turn (i.e. to my right).  I had to move my head down, towards the steering wheel, because my roof was blocking my vision, and I saw the plane at roughly forty-five degrees up and in front and slightly to the right of me ‚Äì like it was over the Wendy‚Äôs restaurant ahead on the right. It then occurred to me that I could only hear traffic and rain noises ‚Äì nothing like the sound of an airplane. Only this one object appeared. I could not say how the object disappeared. It seemed to disappear behind something like a tree. It never seemed to change course. There were no visible contrails. This was visible for perhaps ten seconds. Then, someone in a SUV like mine came up fast on my left (in the left turn lane) and stopped quickly. I could see two people inside, and they were moving around inside ‚Äì flailing their arms. I assumed they wanted me to lower my window, so I did. The vehicle contained a lady driver with dark hair ‚Äì perhaps in her mid-thirties and what may have been a five to ten-year-old girl(?) in the passenger seat. The lady excitedly asked, ‚Äúdid you see that?‚Äù I had been deep in thought ‚Äì trying to understand what I had seen, and because she came from behind me, my first thought was ‚Äúseen what?‚Äù. Then I realized that she had seen this, too. So, I answered, ‚Äúyes‚Äù. She replied, ‚Äúwhat was it?‚Äù, but I had no answer. I did not want to say that it was a ‚Äúflying saucer‚Äù ‚Äì because of how improbable that was, and to nitpick, it did not appear to be round. I then noticed that the traffic light had turned green and that another car was behind me. I wondered if they had seen it, too. Then, I thought ‚Äúthe lady beside me already knows it is unidentified (as in UFO) ‚Äì that‚Äôs why she is asking‚Äù and ‚Äúyou had better answer quickly before people behind us get upset‚Äù. The car immediately behind me came around me on the right (turn lane), but I did not know who else was approaching me from behind. I did not want to scare the little girl in the SUV, but finally, I blurted out ‚Äúa spaceship?‚Äù because I could not think of anything more accurate/likely. While the window was open, I attempted to smell the air for jet fuel, but I could only smell rain. I had my cell phone during the observation, and I considered getting it out to take a photo/movie, but I was wearing blue jeans, and I knew that I could not remove it quickly. Also, it was still raining, and I was somewhat dumbfounded about what I had seen. Then, the object disappeared. I glanced back up, but I could no longer find the ‚Äúairplane‚Äù, so I proceeded through the intersection, and I believe the lady made a left turn. I stopped at a nearby restaurant near the Maynard Road intersection, and then I called my wife. I wrote this description as soon as I arrived home. I am reporting this information as accurately, precise, and truthful as possible.",

I was on an evening walk not far from my house, when I turned in a westerly direction on a residential street.  The time was around 21:00 hours EDT on the date of 7/08/2017.  As I walked generally towards the west, I saw a dark, round object silhouetted against the still bright western sky.  It appeared to be about 50 feet above the tree line at a heading of WNW from my location. It was motionless and emitted no lights or sound.  It also appeared to be slightly wider than it was tall but was generally spherical in shape.  It seemed to be about the size of one of my fingernails, held at arm‚Äôs length, from my perspective. The first thought that came to mind was that I was observing a large tethered balloon some unknown distance away.  I also considered a kite but quickly dismissed that idea as there was barely a breeze and certainly not enough wind to keep a kite aloft.  I continued to walk westerly as I observed the object for about 10-20 seconds before the tree line obscured my view.  In that time, the object did not appear to move at all, but remained completely stationary.  I continued to walk to the end of the street and turned northerly at an intersection.  As I walked farther I tried to again observe the object through breaks in the tree line towards the west but to no avail.  The object was now gone. This is the first time in my life I have ever seen an object in the sky that I could not identify.  It did not appear to be a helicopter, plane or drone and (to reiterate) was completely silent.  It appeared to be much too small to be a hot-air balloon, and I have never seen hot-air balloons floating over my neighborhood in the past 4-1/2 years I have lived here.  Therefore, I am mystified as to what it was.",

My Microsoft Word is expired so I pray this is read by someone in charge.  Watched 3 real UFO craft enter above Orion's Belt in a streak of white but it stopped its streak. One shot straight for the small stadium and no steak was emitted, stopped just short of the main lights to the stadium and hovered around the stadium, wisping from side to side just outside the small stadium as if unhindered from Earth's gravity.  The second seemed to dart in and away from the stadium.  The 3rd was flying up at incredible speed and just stopped in mid-air.  It turned in several degrees of turn I am not able to fathom.  No manned or unmanned craft is capable of such of what I saw.  An incredible sight I kid you not.  The 3rd one showed its belly as it darted up and down in the air with no plausible way to decern how it was able to stop in mid air and go a different direction.  I saw 7 (seven)bright blue and white rotating engines underneath as it flew vertically yet diagonally down for several hundred feet and then it stopped.  This duration happened within about 1:30 to 2:00 minutes time.  Captured a bit on my camera but not enough to give an accurate description.  Sorry. I waved and hollered at the objects to get closer to me but I was not within audible range. The belly of the craft as would be the belly of all three craft had 7 bright blue and white lights.  The shape appearred to be hexigonal or octagonal.  I could see their shapes as their engines made streaks of light in their turns.  Phenominal.  I'd say their weight could not be determined.  The size, if they came face to face would have to be about 13 maybe 14 feet in diameter.  No sound was emitted when they entered, hovered or left.  They left because of a police helicopter was patrolling near the exact area which the 3 craft were hovering as the police helicopter was approaching slowly as it neared the one near the stadium... all three disappeared into the night sky.  As if all were informed of the threat, the police helicoper, and shot out back into space.  After they left, the police helicopter made a b-line to wherever they saw as well.  The one I was watching, didn't change shape, none of them changed shape, they clearly had a top and bottom to them. The top had a curvature to the front of the craft and all three were extremely versitile.  Hope this is enough for further investigation.  Remember. Police Helicopter saw them too.  Very real, not a hoax or a stupid joke.  Odd thou, when they stopped from time to time in flight, I heard no sound, no sound at all.  No shockwave of any sort was audible.  10 years ago, saw a different craft hovering in the same position before the small stadium was built. Tomorrow I will investigate precisely where I saw one of them hover.",

Good evening around 1845 on Thursday Oct 24 2019 my wife and I were driving Northbound toward Los Angeles on the 405. As we were passing through the town of Anaheim we noticed a unusual egg/oval shaped object that appeared to be floating then suddenly moving downward and upward erratically. I quickly pulled out my phone to try and capture what we were both witnessing. What we were seeing was approximately 100 yards off the highway and seemed to be above a parking garage by the looks of it. The color of the craft was grey in color with some shimmery texture to it. It appeared to be maybe 10-15 feet in height but was hard to tell as we were driving and it was moving frantically. I looked online on multiple sights and asked on multiple social media sites to see if anyone else that was around witnessed the same thing. I was able to get a decent 20-25 second video of the craft which I will attach. The first thing I thought of when I saw this was that it‚Äôs a big balloon that usually car dealers put on the cars if they are having a big sale of some sort. But after getting closer and than witnessing the object quickly come down then go back up I realized it couldn‚Äôt be a balloon cause they do not move that erratic or suddenly. Also there was no strings or anything attached to this thing. What I could tell this object was approximately 75-100 feet in the air. A little background on myself, I have noticed unusual objects flying since moving out here in California 4 years ago.  I‚Äôm 28 years old and am a Marine Corps OEF combat veteran.  Served just over 5 years before coming out here.  After that I worked for the government as a contractor and was around aviation heavily so I have a strong deep understanding and knowledge of aviation and in general flying.  This sighting was for sure a bit off and it wasn't anything iv seen nor know of that would be able to maneuver the way this thing did. Hope this was detailed enough and I was able to shed some light on the issue.  Stay vigilant.",

     "text":"Formations of glowing and non-glowing spheres hovering over a Kansas city. Of course, this 4th of July involved fireworks. Note that what I am reporting as \"fireballs\", \"glowing lights\", or hovering spheres, are not the likes of any firework which I am familiar with. Around 9:15 p.m., a friend and I sat on my back porch watching fireworks displays from various neighborhoods around us.  We set off a few of our own, but nothing big.  Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages that day or night, nor do we do drugs; our states of mind were as sharp and relaxed as possible. When looking south, during a lull in the fireworks, we both noticed (and promptly pointed out to each other) 4 objects in the dark sky.  We were looking at about a 35 degree angle of elevation.  The objects seemed to hover in place, making only minuscule adjustments to hold formation due to strong winds.  They glowed with an orange-red light, the closest approximation of which I can make is the HTML Hex code #CC1100.  It was not an extremely strong glow, in that I could not see it illuminating any objects on the ground, trees, or even that much of the smoke present from the fireworks.  However, it was clearly bright enough (or close enough) to reach my friend and I with no problem.  They were arranged in what looked from our viewpoint to be the shape of a rhombus or diamond shape, but I cannot say for sure due to our angle and imperfect depth perception concerning their distance from one another.  They seemed to act together, as though they were all present for the same cause or of! the same force. Other similar formations could be seen from the front of my home looking northward; one directly north and one in the north-northwest.  The latter formation was at a greater distance from us, causing the glows to appear smaller and sort of blend together, creating uncertainty on the number in that formation.  We could only assume that there were also four there, as this is how the others were arranged. The formation to the south was still closest to us, and we mainly observed it.  It remained still, emitting no beams or objects, but the objects seemed to alternate positions every 45 min. or so.  About 5 min. after a rotation, the object closest to us (on a the point of the rhombus) darted towards us significantly. It hovered now above the pond directly behind my house.  It faded in color and luminescence as it neared, becoming completely matte black by the time it reached us.  It hovered there, and had it not been for fireworks on the horizon and city lights illuminating the haze, it would have blended easily into the night sky.  We had a Nikon D5000 with an external flash and telephoto lens, and immediately started fumbling for it to try to capture it on camera.  The camera would not boot up. It usually takes about half a second to turn on and become ready to shoot, if that.  But it wouldn't. The battery was charged, for we tried two of them, both of which had been charged that day.  It was in the right way and there should have been nothing to interfere.  In the dark, I tried to use my lighter to see if there was some fault or something that could prevent it from working.  It was a push-button or electronic butane aerosol lighter, where one clicks a button down, creating a spark, and igniting a jet of butane fuel.  The fuel came out as usual when the button was depressed, but the spark would not work. Neither would my friend's. We took this to mean that after going into some sort of less detectable mode, it also activated a device that shut down certain electronic capabilities within a reasonable proximity.  Unable to capture it, we could only stand in awe.  It looked to be about 15 ft. in diameter, and rotating a bit in one direction before reversing its spin. It spun fairly slowly, almost like it was just drifting there.  After about 3 min. of suspension, it flew back to its formation.  It did not change color, but by the time the craft got back, the formation was then the same shade of matte black.  It was unbelievable how...black it really was. It seemed to just suck in all light.  There were minor indentations around the craft, visible when not luminous, around the \"equator\".  Just short dashes, impressed into the material. This allowed us to notice the rotation before. After reforming, the formation flew northward at unnatural speeds.  There was no time for acceleration. It was just...going.  It went from a stop to its desired speed immediately and remained steady at that speed until arriving near the northern formations.  They joined to form a loose squarish shape. This larger formation flew northward while gaining altitude at a steady pace.  I can't imagine why only the one formation would go into its \"undetectable\" or stealth mode while in the larger formation, but it remained that way during its exit. My friend has done no real research into ufology or related fields, and previously was just oblivious.  He had no opinion.  He always took a tolerant, but non-believing, attitude towards matters like this. I have read numerous books, online articles, and viewed a vast amount of serious multimedia on the subject, including photographs, video recordings, and audio clips.  I don't consider myself to be a serious researcher by any means, but I do take matters of this nature seriously.",

     "text":"Silver Objects Hovering Above Los Angeles It has taken me some time to finally write about this issue.  For a number of years now I have seen either a single star like object in the daytime very high up hovering in the sky or I have seen a formation of these same objects.  On one occasion I was with two other individuals and pointed them out and they saw them and we watched them move and hover in ways that no traditional aircraft operate. I am writing this now because this past weekend on two consecutive days (August 9th and 10th) I saw a single silver star like object motionless in the daytime sky. Both days were perfect weather wise with very clear visibility. On August the 9th in the afternoon at about 4 PM PST I noticed a silver colored point of light hovering in Eastern Sky perhaps 50 to 55 degrees from the horizon. I thought it might be a plane moving away from me and the sun was reflecting on it at an odd angle. But it just hung there with what I thought was perhaps a vibrating like movement. My wife was standing with me holding our 3 month old as we were preparing to go on a walk and she saw it as well. After about 3 to 5 minutes we couldn‚Äôt see it anymore. It appeared to just fade away but not like an object moving off ‚Äì it either faded out or turned in such a way that the sun wasn‚Äôt hitting it. I think it important to note that the light may have been the sun reflecting off the object but while the object appeared very small and far away it was star like and obviously bright enough to been seen by the naked eye. The following day on the 10th at approximately 5:30 in the afternoon I again took the baby outside to sit on our front porch swing which faces east. I had this odd feeling that I would see the object again and when I looked up between two nearby trees there it was again in the sky. The object was higher this time but brighter and closer to my position. It began to slowly drift a bit from North to South and I knew in a moment it would be obscured by the leaves of one of the trees. Now I don‚Äôt know why but I tried, perhaps foolishly, to meditate on the object and make a \"connection,\" but it just kept drifting very, very slowly south. It was not a balloon, plane or helicopter and again the sky was perfectly clear and visibility was excellent. It would soon be out of my view so I slowly got up and went to see it from the front yard but when I looked up again it was gone. I searched the sky but to no avail. The entire encounter again lasted maybe five minutes but certainly less than ten. I am writing to you because I have seen these objects in the sky in LA before. They are not traditional aircraft. In the past I have seen them in formation and have seen them do patterns and maneuvers that, in my opinion, can not be easily explained. I have seen them with others present so I know I‚Äôm not just imagining things. Could these be the US military aerial Predator drones? I was thinking perhaps they are tested out from a nearby base. Wouldn‚Äôt they hover at high altitude? Could I just be seeing a satellite in geosynchronous orbit?

It appeared to slow, and I  called to my husband to look. It then appeared to dtop and hover. At that point, we said it must be a weather or party balloon. Seconds later, it made a sharp left turn to the north, and accelerated in speed. My husband lost track of it, but I followed it to approximately the 10:00 position, where it simply blinked out of sight. I watched for moments after, scanning the sky, but it was gone.  .",

     "text":"Orange Orbs on multiple nights and finally a large Mother ship also Orange. Orange Orbs March 14 2011   I am an avid sky watcher.  I want to make that point clear.  Since my first sighting in 1979 I have been quietly obsessed with our universe and the many cultures that abound throughout.  I want also to be clear that I rarely ever report what I see to anyone other than my friends and family. In August of 2010, I began to see Orange Orbs at fairly close range with the lot of my home either front or back yard being my vantage point.  The first one I saw was after sunset but prior to the dark of night.  While talking on the phone standing on my patio when, as if directed in some way, I turned my head and focused directly on the orange orb heading my direction and saw it clearly.  I told the person on the phone what I was witnessing, stating that this was a ‚Äúgood one‚Äù.  At best guess I would say the real size of the object was about 2 to 4 feet spherical.  The orange glow at least gave it the look of being spherical.  I figure it was at an altitude of 75 to 150 feet and maybe 200 yards downrange.  I always have binoculars on the table so I told my party I was reaching for them.  As I reached I knew that the orb was watching me.  I knew that it was reading my thoughts and when I grabbed the binoculars it, as best as I can describe, folded into thin air.  The total e! lapsed time was maybe 45 seconds. The next visit was just two evenings later.  This time I was in the front of my house.  While playing darts with my nephew, I received a phone call.  My dartboard is in the garage so I took my call to the driveway in the front of the house.  I am a pacer, especially when I talk on the phone: While pacing up and down my driveway, just like the last time, I was almost summoned to turn my head and look up.  I did and there it was again, the orange orb.  This time it was much closer to me.  It was visibly about three times the size of a basketball, slowly moving about twice the height of my one story rooftop, between my neighbor‚Äôs house and mine.  Again I told the party on the phone, ‚ÄúThere is that orb again‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWes check it out!‚Äù  (Wes is my nephew) I told him to hurry and grab those binoculars.  All the while I never took my eyes off of the orb.  It was communicating with me.  I could feel it.  And the moment Wes grabbed the binoculars and started toward me it, once again, fo! lded into thin air. This was two sightings in as many days and I could feel that the orb was aware of me and it knew that I was aware of it.  I might also mention that I have had a number of sightings; I have lunched with Bob Lazar at a pizza place in Vegas.  Been to black box road several times, and so on.  These were the first ‚ÄúOrbs‚Äù that I have witnessed.  Well three nights later I had another visit.  This time I was just pacing in the driveway waiting for my pup to handle her business when I, as if someone called my name turned and looked right at the hovering orb.  This time it was a good 200 feet in altitude and over the middle of my street.  I stared for about 10 seconds, pointed to it and said, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt disappear again.‚Äù And backed into the garage trying to keep my eyes fixed and at the same time reaching for my binoculars and at risk of sounding insane, I felt it smile and just like that it folded into the night sky again.  At this point I am sure that there is something big happ! ening.  I do not mean in general.  That is obvious.  I mean specifically with me.  I thought finally after all these years of trying to telepathically reach out, someone is picking up the cottin pickin phone. Nights   turned into weeks, they quickly turned into months.  Each night diligently going out to call to the orb while stargazing and nothing except for maybe one sighting about 1000 yards down the street and higher in altitude but I am only 70 percent sure that was the orb.  That is until tonight.  While playing darts again in my garage, I stepped to the driveway and pointed calling, ‚ÄúDude, tell me you are seeing that.‚Äù  This was not the orb but a huge ship!  Much higher, I would say 1500 to 3000 feet in altitude, maybe 1.5 to 3 miles down range, and glowing like a mini sun but it was longer top to bottom then left to right, it split into 4 equal size large orbs that slightly angled toward the ground, then, immediately went back to one, back to two larger at an angle again back to 1 large round, then stretched upward and blipped out. I have witnessed some very awesome stuff.  This ranks in the top three for me of all time.  My nephew could not believe that finally after hearing me talk about ufos and aliens for years he finally saw that.  It was a short sighting but a very fantastic one.  Of course I checked out all of the obvious possibilities knowing full well that what we had seen was genuine.  I have seen almost the identical thing on a post on some website, and I believe it was a film from Norway.  I could be wrong on that.  Needless to say it was significant enough to warrant this report.  I would like to hear of the many comparisons that are out there.  I know that we are and have been visited here since the beginning.  My being is fully aware of the endosymbiotic relationship that we all share with one another, with our Creator, and with the Planet, Galaxy and the Universe.  I spend countless hours as a crack researcher from UFOs to Mars anomalies, to alien races, underground bases, and the whol! e lot of it.  I throw out most hang on to some and dig into others.  I have always had a connection with space for some reason, as a child I was so afraid of ufos I would not sleep in my room alone until about the 8th grade and that was in 1979 I think.  I do not think I was ever abducted at least I do not think I was.  I may be privy to something I am not yet aware of but that is yet to be revealed.  I have the gift of sight and can see things in people that freak me out still.  Most of my closest friends know me as ‚ÄúThe Profit.‚Äù  I simply can see through some sort of window when prompted to do so. Anyway, I just felt compelled to put this one on the record.  I will continue to look for them every night and will report back if they continue.  If you are in the know keep digging, if you are skeptical, look up once in a while, you will eventually be shown. If you are a government official, I feel sorry for you.  Just kidding, but if you are, help bring full disclosure.  We as a race deserve the truth.  Peace to all and may your spirit find its source and one day know it.",

     "text":"Two different craft, broad daylight, shape and flight characterists inconsistent with any known aircraft resending, as my paragraph breaks got lost, making it one nasty block of text... Brief:  While taking a cigarette break at my place of work, outside the building (side facing the parking lot, opposite from James Street), I spotted two different distinct airborne craft less than a minute apart, which exhibited shape and flight characteristics not consistent with any known manmade aircraft or bird. (having had an unequivocal daylight UFO sighting in my youth, I will often specifically watch the skies, and spot birds and aircraft while I‚Äôm outside on smoke breaks during my workday.  In 13 years working in this location, this is the first time I‚Äôve seen something here in daylight that I could not identify, and thus qualifies as a legitimate UFO sighting)   Sighting detail:  I was looking up at the sky to the Northeast with the sun at my back, and spotted a black object of indeterminate size at a high altitude, at approximately 55 degrees above the horizon.  At that distance, it was difficult to make out any detail, though it appeared to be elongated.  By comparison, it appeared to be the approximate scale of a hyphen on a printed page held at arms length, ever so slightly thicker in the middle.  No lights of any kind were observable on the craft, and it did not change shape as would a bird flapping it‚Äôs wings. I noticed it because it was moving erratically, zig-zagging back and forth, and up and down.   It would dart to the left, stop in mid air, wiggle up and down, dart back the other way, stop, and wiggle up and down.   It did not move in perfectly straight lines, and its movement was jerky and appeared uncoordinated. As I observed the erratic flight, I first said to myself, ‚Äúwow, I‚Äôm actually seeing this!‚Äù   Judging it‚Äôs travel distance back and forth when it was darting is difficult without knowing it‚Äôs approximate size or distance, but if it were the size of a sparrow, it would have been darting back and forth, from my left to right and back, covering a distance of at least 100 feet per second when it moved, with no noticeable acceleration or deceleration.  It would be moving, then stationary, then moving again at high speed.  I observed it darting erratically as described for approximately 25 seconds.  Then it began to move smoothly at a high rate of speed toward the southeast, and became too distant to observe after approximately 15 seconds.  I continued to observe the area of sky where it disappeared for a further minute or so, and saw it come back into view again momentarily, before vanishing again. At this point, I returned to looking at the patch of sky where it had first appeared, and within about 30 seconds, there appeared a bright white cigar or disc shaped object, following the trajectory of the first object.  This object may have been larger or closer to me, as it was much easier for me to see that it was an elongated shape.  It had a much clearer ‚Äúcigar‚Äù or disc shape, bulging in the middle, and tapered/rounded at the edges.  It was moving at a constant high rate of speed toward the southwest, and left no contrail.  It moved across the sky considerably faster than the jetliners frequently visible form this location, following exactly the flight path of the first object, and also receded too far to be visible after approximately 25 seconds. Just before it disappeared from view to the Southwest (over Downtown Syracuse), a co-worker came out of the building and asked what I was looking at, and I pointed it out, but at that point it was too faint for him to observe. When I first sighted the second object, I could see that it did not have wings or a tail, and approximately every five seconds, what appeared to be a large bright white light on the top center of the ‚Äúcigar shape‚Äù would appear, fade up to very bright, (brighter than the object itself) then fade out again over the course of about three seconds.  It did not blink, it faded in and out.  This repeated at regular intervals until it was out of sight in the southwest sky.  The object did not change course, and moved at a uniform very high rate of speed, faster than any plane. At the moment the second object faded from view, a twin engine jetliner (appeared to be a Boeng Triple-7) was passing in an easterly path through the middle of the area where I‚Äôd observed the other objects, at approximately 8,000 feet.  It‚Äôs wings, engines, horizontal stabilizer, and twin contrail were clearly discernable.  It appeared approximately 3 times larger at that distance than the other two objects I had observed.  I do not believe that either object was closer to me than the jetliner. At that altitude, the jetliner was traversing the sky at approximately one forth the rate of the two objects I had just observed, meaning that if they had been at a similar altitude and distance, their speed of travel would have been, at minimum  four times the minimum stall speed of such an aircraft, or approximately 800 Knots / 920 miles per hour / 1480 kilometers per hour. Neither object made any sound that I noticed, nor was the jetliner loud enough for me to hear it above the noise of the city from that altitude. (I do not carry a phone with a camera, and was unable to obtain images of the sighting.  However, I'm am going to take photographs of the location, and draw on the photos to clearly indicate what I witnessed.  I will also include an aerial photo map indicating observer position, and approximate flightpath of objects observed.  I will forward those as soon as available.)   (further notes)   Witness background:  I‚Äôm am a white male, 45 years old, professional.  My vision is better than 20/20, based on my eye test for my driver‚Äôs license renewal earlier this year.  I have never needed glasses or contacts. In my 20‚Äôs, I was in the National Guard, assigned to a helicopter maintenance battalion, and I am well familiar with the flight characteristics and capabilities of both military and civilian aircraft, having observed countless planes / helicopters in flight.  I have spent a considerable amount of time around military and civilian airfields, and aboard both rotor-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.  I can tell the difference between a Sikorsky and a Bell helicopter in flight at a distance of several miles. My older brother was a private pilot, and owned two single-engine fixed-wing aircraft, with which he gave me informal flight instruction, and I have flown both of those aircraft numerous times, also having performed unassisted takeoffs, and landings under the supervision of a licensed pilot.  I have also been a passenger on numerous commercial aircraft.  Given my experience with aviation, I consider myself to be a better observer of aircraft than the average layperson, and also reasonably accurate at determining the size, altitude, and distance of objects I observe in the sky. Witness sobriety:  Prior to this sighting, I had not had any alcohol for over 36 hours, and I do not indulge in any other intoxicants.   This morning I had a cup of coffee and a couple of cigarettes.",

     "text":"On September 2, 2009, my wife and I were sitting out on the back patio as we do every night. It was around 9:30 pm, a little later than our usual time.  The moon was almost full and very bright, the skies were perfectly clear and very low humidity for us here in Louisiana. Jupiter was bright and almost parallel at the time we were looking up. We were about to give up and go inside when I caught a glimpse of something that I first thought was a shooting star. I quickly pointed at it and told the wife to look before it faded away. But, it did not fade away.  I then though it was one of the plentiful White Cranes we have here in Louisiana, but I quickly realized it was not flapping any wings. My wife and I started asking each other what is that?  The object appeared to be a large wing shape and white, and had sort of a faint glow as if light was reflecting off of it. It was moving at a very fast speed, coming from the east headed directly west. It did not very the speed, or waiver off of its direct course. We were able to view it until it just faded in the west sky. We were both stunned at what we just saw. We love to star gaze and watch for meteors and satellites, and I'm an avid NASA site watcher and I always know when the ISS or Shuttle are in viewing range, and we watch it every chance we have. But this was so different. As we stood there reflecting on what just happened, we started re-playing it out loud to each other, trying to make a logical explanation of what it could have been, either a plan, a bird, whatever, but we were completely puzzled and amazed.. Here are some details that we recalled and discussed that really made this sighting even more mysterious to us. When it first appeared over the house it was already visible. The moon was very bright so if it was a low flying object it would not have been reflecting the moon light from the bottom, which made it appear to be glowing from within itself. It was not a bird because the wings never moved, it was moving very fast (faster moving than the ISS sightings) and it never fluttered or altered from its direct line of flight. It made absolutely no sound. There were no white, red, green, or blinking lights on it. We live in the flight pattern to the airport just 10 miles away, so we are very familiar with what aircraft looks like on its approach. When it faded from view, it was some where around 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon in the west sky, and I know from my many years of keeping up with the ISS, it would never be moving from east to west. Also, if it would have been a ! low flying object, it would have disappeared due to obstructions such as houses in the neighbor hood or the trees in the woods just west of us. So, since after nearly 50 years of looking at the skies, and since this was the first time I ever saw anything I could not apply logic to, I felt I needed to write this down, share it, and hope to find out if anyone else saw it, or anything similar to it. I would love it if someone could explain what it was.",

My husband and I looked out the window in our front door and notice an immensely bright light. It was about 4 times brighter and about twice the size of what Venus is viewed as from the same viewing location. We watched as the light (indiscernible shape due to brightness of light) moved along and through the treetops seemingly not far from our home location. It swooped back and forth as if scanning, or \"looking around\". It seemed as if the light was mostly on one side because as it swooped it the light would seem to face away and then back towards us. But not like a helicopter, it seemed as if the whole face of the thing was light.  As the sun came up I noticed a couple other small crafts seemingly interacting with the larger one. They were the size of what we observe as satellites on other nights, but one seemed to be orbiting the large light and the other went off to the right of the light and came back to it within minutes. The craft moved in a climbing pattern to the right over about a 15 minute time period and then we watched it get smaller and smaller as we could tell it was leaving but it was leaving directly away from us, we lost visual as the huge bright light (still immensely bright even with the sun rising) became a speck in the upper outer atmosphere..  The other odd thing about this sighting (not sure if it is related but I feel worth noting) was that the whole time there was a glowing orange light off to the left that we thought might have been a neighbors light (even though it DID seem closer than the nearest neighbor..) but we haven't seen it since that morning.",

While we were stopped in heavy traffic, the 2nd \"copter\" swayed erratically from side to side above the busy highway.  It stopped suddenly in mid-air, then turned sharply toward the east, all the while rapidly changing altitude.  It continued to sway from side to side and to bounce up and down. We could see it was not a helicopter, but was an extremely large cube or boxy silver object.  It morphed into an elongated box, then became a sphere and then a whole array of boxy shapes, as it hovered, and raised and lowered its altitude.  We saw no lights on it.  There were no vapors coming from it.  When it changed shape it would momentarily shine like a piece of reflective aluminum. Finally it just shot off to the northeast at a high rate of speed.  I was driving and had to focus on traffic, but my husband in the passenger seat watched the object until it disappeared completely.  The entire episode lasted approximately 5-10 minutes. It was high noon, the sky was a light grey, there was no rain, and no wind. Visibility was about five miles.",

     "text":"Seen Three aliens three different times outside my window within 2 weeks I saw three translucent inter-dimensional beings out my window three times in 2 weeks   I was sitting on my recliner in my living room.  I was watching my Television and I noticed something in the trees.  I looked through my big glass window that looks onto the back of the apartment building. I saw three aliens or some kind of beings in my trees.  At least I thought they were in the trees. The tree line is about 10 feet my window.  They were about 4  feet off the ground. I was scared to death, I could not move, I just froze with fear.  There were three of them. They were sitting side by side. At least I think they were sitting, hard to tell because they were translucent. I could see right through them, seeing the leaves move behind them.  Like in the movie ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù they were kind of see through but the outline of them was visible. They were on a platform.  They had very long arms and the width of their bodies were about 6.  Their height was maybe 1 foot, hard to tell since I was not sure if they were sitting or standing.  This was about 10.am around the first week of July, of 2009 in Milwaukee Wisconsin.  I am in an apartment complex that is two stories‚Äô high and 10 apartments wide.  Mostly very nice Mexican people live here.  I am from Georgia.  I mention that in case this becomes significant since there are so many sightings of  UFO‚Äôs in Mexico. In no way were these Grays aliens that people talk about.  The face was cone shaped. I could not really make out eyes or any features.  Obviously they were cloaked or thought they were invisible, I do not know.  They stared at me the whole time, never looking around, just right at me for about 4 minutes.   Finally I got the nerve to stand up slowly and make my way to the front door. I knew the window was open; I wanted to close it because I was afraid they would come in and abduct me. Or do experiments as we hear about what happens to people.  As I had my back to them for only a second, I turned to look back but they had gone. I then went too quickly to my neighbor‚Äôs apartment. She asked me if I had seen a ghost. I said just something very weird. I would not tell her for being afraid of her thinking I was crazy. I was so afraid I told no body. Not even my boyfriend who was out of town for the next two weeks. I was there alone. I want to let you know. I am a 48 year old woman from Georgia. I do not do drugs, I do drink a beer here and there but I had not had any beer for about a week. I have never hallucinated or imagined anything in my whole life. I am not on any prescription drugs and have never been on them. I was really seeing this and wish I had never had. So when Mark came home from working in Canada I did not tell him even though I was still scared. A couple mornings after he was home he woke me to ask if I have ever seen anything weird out the back window.  I said yes, why are you asking me? He was scared, I could tell as he started to tell me that he saw three beings out the back window in the trees that he could see through. It was about 5:30 as we slept in the living room all night since it is cooler then than our bedroom. We have had placed our mattress on the floor near the front door. He said there were three of them side by side with cone faces, long arms and almost he could make out! eyes or holes where there would be eyes. He described them exactly as I had seen them and also they were on a platform. He said the platform was a milky color but still translucent. He could see the outline and see the leaves right through them. He said their heads were moving up and down, to the right to the left looking at the back of out apartment building. He was sure they did not see him since he was so far from the window near the front door on the mattress which is on the floor. When I am in my recliner I am only about 4 feet from the window. He said they were there for about 4 minutes also then they disappeared. When I asked him to point right where he saw them, it was interesting because they were on the right side of our window but when I saw them they were on the left side. Remember now both times were in the morning and same description. He said they were doing something with their hands, maybe working controls? I don‚Äôt know, I am just scared out of my mind the! y will come back again. I was happy I could share this bizarre! happeni ng in out lives. So about two days after Mark had seen them I was in my recliner watching Television. It was around 9 a.m in the morning. I saw movement in the trees again and this time there was only one of the beings. I saw him for about only about 1 minute or minute and a half or so. This time he was in the middle of the window about the same height in the trees. His cone shaped face and long hanging arms, looking right at me. I was very scared and had a look of fear on my face. Mark was in the room and when he saw my face he saw I was scared but when he turned his head to look it disappeared. Now I have been analyzing this highly unusual event. I am scared all time. I am in fear they will take mark or myself to where to do what? Why appear behind an old run down apartment building in virtually the same place area in the trees? This has reoccurred three times in the morning hours. From about a minute and a half to about 4 minutes they stay to study mark or I? To take readings of the Earth, say maybe they are measuring the Earths magnetic field, gasses in atmosphere? Are they planning an attack on mankind? Do they want to become our friends? Learn our language? Are they just as curious about us as we are of them? Do they want to reproduce with our species? Do they want to use us as food? So many things run through our heads, WHY WHY HERE? Why not appear at the White House, a museum, a school, a park or in a science laboratory? Why behind an old apartment building at OUR WINDOW? Are the other people in the apartments seeing them also? I am not ready to ask around. I want to move out of here as quickly as I can but for financial reasons I don‚Äôt see that happening anytime soon. Maybe they will never appear again and my nerves can calm down. My girlfriend Mary is vey excited about this. She wants to see them very badly so she can take photos or video tape them to show the world. She says this is very important for the world to see that beings are showing up here repeatedly. She says they probably are not from another world but from another dimension. That maybe their laboratory in their dimension is situated right there at all times but the veil from our dimensions are opening up. They are not really in the trees at all but in their time and a different dimension. They could be opening and closing them. They are showing up as almost invisible, is that because they are scared that we will shoot them? They know enough that this is a common reaction among humans, Shoot first ask questions later. Do they even know we see them at all? Mary says we can roll up a ball of yarn with a long string on the end. When they appear throw it at them, it might go into their place and we might see just a string hanging in mid air! when they closed the veil. The yarn will not show harmful intent because we could put a note on it saying :Become our friends, Talk to us, we know your there. We could put a little present inside the ball of yarn. She wants to bring in a high tech video camera, digital camera, regular camera, infrared camera, aura camera and a meter she has that can pick up very low frequencies that turns it into voice.

     "text":"Spherical flashing lights, hovering in the northwestern sky, no sound I woke up at 5.28 a.m.  and went to look out the windows on the western side of my house, as I have seen lights in the western sky before.  There was a spherical light in the northwestern sky.  It had FLASHING lights of white, green, red, NOT STROBE LIGHTS as on a plane.  The object stayed in the same spot and hovered around for nearly an hour and then moved off slowly to the north.  I thought maybe it was some kind of balloon, but we have been having 30-40 mph winds here for two days, so don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it.  As it moved north it did not disappear on the horizon, just got smaller.  Then it changed shape and took on an elongated, cigar shape, with white lights flashing all around it, and blue/green lights flashing on one end.  Directly to the west, as this was hovering, there was another light, hovering, not as close, flashing more red.  I shined a flashlight in the direction of this one, looked away, then looked back and the red light was gone. We see a lot of airline and military air traffic where we are.  I saw planes go by as I watched these objects.  The objects looked to be much lower than the airplanes. I saw this same object, the spherical flashing, in October of 2008.  A couple of weeks before Christmas 2009, I saw this object early in the morning, around 5 a.m., only in the southwestern sky.  It seemed to flash a white light on the ground like a camera flash.  It was brighter that time (maybe closer?), hovered, then moved off to the west/southwest (NOT over the horizon) and disappeared. My husband is a commercial pilot.  I have flown in commercial jets and Cessnas, seen them take off and land, been around them for 20 years.  This object does not behave like an airplane or have lights like one.  We live near a menhaden fish processing factory, which is right off the Chesapeake Bay.  I wonder if it is something maybe monitoring the pollution at the factory?

Just after the Sagtikos Pkwy and coming to the top of the hill we saw just ahead of us and to the north, 3 disc or oval shape orange glowing lights in the sky. They seemed to be very low. I pulled to the side of the road and grabbed my camera I was able to take 2 photos before the objects swirled in unison and moved up and forward quickly and disappeared north and west. I turned the car around and headed up the ramp of the parkway toward the beach to try and see if we could see them again. Nothing, so I turned around and was coming back in the same exact direction approaching the top of the hill again when 2 more of them appeared and this time they seemed MUCH lower I noted again that they made no sound at all and that there was no flicker, like a flame but did appear to have a glowing ember type of quality to it but it seemed to be 'containe! d' in the sphere. In other words it didn't seem to have a fire or flame quality, just a glow of red orange and bright yellow. These 2 discs went in a quick formation of up and down and zoomed to the right before quickly zipping to the north and west again and disappeared. We waited there for another 2 minutes before driving off and just then 1 more appeared directly in front of us just above the tree line and hovered and seemed to get bigger as if it it was coming straight down and toward us, then quickly went north and west in the same direction as the others and disappeared. Again, there was no sound from them. It was eery and unbelievable. I do not believe in such things but I cannot explain this. I reviewed the pictures with my husband when I got home and they are amazing and show the exact shape as well as a hazy silvery glow that appeared as the discs disappeared. I did not even think I caught the objects because I took the photos so fast, but they are astonishing. I ! hope someone else saw them and will report. I will have my eye! s up to the sky more often.",

I was sitting outside at night with 3 other people in my backyard. It was around 10:40PM or so, nearing 11PM. From my backyard I am able to see a view of the El Paso mountains in the distance, and am able to see Transmountain Road, which is a long road that is a shortcut to get from the northeast side of town to the west side by cutting through rather than going around the mountain.  From our view you can see the headlights driving by from the cars in a certain area that drive by, but they are high up in elevation on the lower half of the mountain from the view we have. Two of us (myself and another) were sitting in the backyard facing away from the mountain, while the other two were sitting able to view the mountains and transmountain road, and one of them noticed this faint light above the mountains, she pointed and asked what it was, it was probably a hundred feet above or so, not sure but it was high up enough to look like a star, because that's what we thought it was. Thankfully, she didn't believe it was a star - and kept staring at it and suddenly told us it was moving, so we all turned to focus on it, it was so faint we didn't think anything of it for a couple of minutes except it was this hazy purple, it was the exact coloring if you stare at a black light, you can't really focus on it and it had this purple tone to it.  We thought there might be a cloud in front, but it was a clear night, the object was hazy. So trying to focus on it in the sky, we can begin to see this faint purple/blue light begins to slowly move, side to side, diagonally, in very unusual patterns at different speeds, and then it began to slowly fly behind the mountain, and as we watched it, for about 5 to 10 seconds it went out of sight.  We thought that was all there was to it, but we stayed looking, we all kind of wished it would come back, and we got our wish... It suddenly came back up and began to float down the mountain but it moves down in different ways, at first it went straight down and then diagonally, just erratic movements and it suddenly gets closer to the cars that are driving on transmountain, so we see this faint purple light get closer and closer to the cars and two of us are really scared that it will crash down, but the other two people with me tried to get out a really bad telescope of mine that didn't work properly - but hoping to be able to use it to see what this object is!  Then it suddenly pauses in front of one of the cars, almost like the object hit the brakes and it lights up so brightly I squinted, and we all just gasped in awe and fear. Then immediately it shot down below the road into the base of the mountain near an area that has no residential homes, it shot down from the right, then to the left and then out of sight. Being so scared we were expecting to see it come back up into the sky, maybe even fly over us but thankfully nothing.  We called into the non emergency phone line in El Paso to ask if anyone had seen strange lights, and they told us no. After that, a day later we went up to Transmountain to see if we could see anything below in the desert, and of course we found nothing unusual looking. I've seen in the mid 90's strange objects in the sky over Ft. Bliss (military base) area which is east of where I lived, objects that would blink and shine light onto the roof of the house in front of ours (without any sound, like a helicopter light should have), but never have I seen this black light colored object, erratically flying around near where a lot of cars drive back and forth 24/7, and if it was anything government made, we wondered why it would be so close to cars, seemed dangerous.  I just wonder if the drivers on Transmountain saw the object, because when it lit up so bright it seemed everyone would have been able to see it!  But it seems nobody noticed it but us that night, and we stayed out for many nights after that hoping to see it again but we haven't yet.",

Perfect day with no clouds, sunny blue sky , 65-70 degrees warm.  May 5th 2011 5:30pm  I was outside putting a brick walkpath in the front of my parents house, and I heard a very strange airplane flying, I looked up and there was a japanese zero (had the rising sun symbol on both wings) flying directly above my house. While looking at this plane, I noticed a strange white or silver object in the sky alot higher, and behind the plane.  The object looked like it was leaking water. I raced in the house to get my camera (sony dcr-trv140 digital 8mm) and my mom. I turned on the camera and focused on the object.  It appeared to be reflecting sunlight very well indicating it was very reflective.  It was possibly round or sphere shaped and possibly spinning, but I cannot confirm this because the sunlight made it look like it was changing shape. I was zoomed in on the object to 20x optical, and could clearly see what appeared to be a vapor, or steam, or something leaking out of the bottom of it. The only thing I could imagine it being is a weather balloon, and the leaking portion just an illusion, quite possibly a long tether?  I recorded as much of the event as I could but my lens fogged up badly due to my sweating face, and could no longer see the object with my eyes.  I have about 5 minutes of high frame rate video of the object, in digital 8mm format.",

     "text":"3 objects in the night sky moving @ high rate of speed. On Oct. 14/2010 @ aprox. 22:05hrs. I noticed two objects coming from the north, traveling parallel with each other aprox. ¬Ω-inch apart as viewed in the night sky, in the area of the big dipper, moving south toward the moon.    As I watched, I noticed there was a third object in front of the first two, approximately three inches in front of them.  All three objects were moving at the same rate of speed until they reached directly over head of me.  Then the western most object of the two rear objects, pulled ahead of the eastern most object, accelerated, then dropped back.  It did this five times while I observed them.  They continued on at a very high rate of speed & I lost sight of them as they approached the moon‚Äôs glare. I called the airport & talked airport authority, told him what I saw, and asked if he could call the tower & see if air traffic control had seen anything weird on their radar.  When he came back on line he said they hadn‚Äôt seen anything on radar & gave me your phone # to report it. The objects were moving with the speed of a satellite re-entering earth orbit on burn up. Very fast!! It took only about 20 seconds to cover a huge portion of the sky.  I would estimate their altitude @ over 30,000 feet.  I realize it‚Äôs hard to approximate altitude @ night, but they seemed very high. Description of the objects is as follows, they had a brownish / copper color nucleus in the center, almost square shaped with a weak halo encircling them.  The scale of the halo would be the same size if you placed a dime over top of  Jupiter in the night sky.  The color is what made me notice them, they seemed darker than the night sky and were blocking out starlight as they came toward me.  The halo was a perfect sphere with a very pale bluish, white light to it, almost transparent.  The intensity of the object never changed, but the clarity of my view improved as they went directly overhead of me. The size is as stated previously, approximately Jupiter sized object as viewed in the night sky, with the halo extending approximately the size of dime if laid over Jupiter. I am a amateur astronomer, with a 12\" Mead LX200 scope.  I was out in the night sky since dusk & my eyes had adapted to the low light. Unfortunately I did not get the chance to put the scope on the objects as they were moving very fast & I just was too excited & didn‚Äôt want to miss what I was seeing or lose them in the night sky.   I have view comets, chased satellites with my naked eye & scope.  Spent countless hours observing the stars & sky‚Äôs at night and never have seen anything like this before.  The thing that really got me was when the one object accelerated & dropped back several times, nothing in the night sky does that!!   I have lived by the airport for 11 years & observed all kinds of aircraft @ night, it definitely was not any type of aircraft.   I did think it was a satellite until I noticed the second object & then a third object which led me to the realization that they were U.F.O.‚ÄôS!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the source of the report, on two occasions, and we deem him to be an exceptionally good witness.",

     "text":"Before last night, I always shook my head and thought everyone who told a UfO/ alien story was silly and ridiculous. I am a VERY big skeptic when it comes to this type of thing. But what I saw last night cannot be explained. My friend and I had just picked my brother up from a driver education course at 9:00 pm.  We stopped at a Taco Bueno to get some food on our way home.   As we were driving East on highway 20, we were about four minutes from where it goes from four lanes to two lanes, when I saw two bluish spotlights shining down on the oncoming lanes of traffic. About the same time I saw this, the spotlights rose into a horizontal position, shining on my car when they did.  As the spotlights raised up I saw the underbelly of what seemed to be a trapezoidal middle with two right triangle shaped wings that held the big blue/white spotlights. The wings seemed more like anchors for the spotlights than actual wings.  They were not long and slender like and airplane, but were fat, short, and stocky with the spotlight on the ends.  The underbelly had four or six sets of rectangular greenish yellow panels on the front end and back end.  These panels seemed almost like you could see into the aircraft through them, like they were a type of viewing panels.  I saw these things so very clearly because this aircraft was only about the height of a two or three story building.  This aircraft was also not in flight, it was merely hovering, but it did kind of sway as the spotlights rose. My friend was in the passenger seat and saw the exact same thing I did.  My little brother was in the back seat and from his position he couldn‚Äôt really see it.  My friend reminded me to pay attention to driving as the aircraft seemed to be preparing to fly forward.  As we drove past it I could no longer see the craft and told my brother to try to get a look.  My brother caught a glimpse of the bluish lights, but he did not see any detail. This aircraft made absolutely no noise.  We did not have the raidio on at all in the car and as soon as we saw it we didn‚Äôt say anything but hushed ‚Äúare you seeing this?‚Äù and my brother‚Äôs quieted questions of what we were looking at.  If this thing had made a noise, like any craft that close to us would, we would have heard it. Upon returning home I described this sighting to my mother, she sat down with us and we all explained in detail what happened. In the middle of my description, my mother gasped and covered her mouth. She quickly told me that as she was peeking out of the blinds, hoping to see our headlights (she was worried because us stopping to get food took longer than she expected), she saw something she had shrugged off as probably her imagination at the time. She saw a bluish spotlight shining up and then down our driveway and disappear. She didn‚Äôt see any cars before or after this light and she swore it was not any kind of headlight reflection or anything, it was like a light being shown from the sky. I called my boyfriend who is an Intel analyst for the military and he assured me there is no aircraft in our military that is like the one I described. I welcome anyone who thinks they have a reasonable explanation, but so far I have found none.",

     "text":"CT RIVER PENINSULA SIGHTING(s).  2 Witnesses kayaking just before dawn. 3-6am. 6/21/14 A longtime friend and I were fishing in kayaks on the Connecticut River.  He and I are both 34 year old college educated males.  We both work nights (I've been a full time firefighter EMT-B  for 7 years), so it's not unusual for us to go out in the CT river or on the Mattabasset all night and stay out sometimes into the next day until almost lunchtime.   I am (or was) a UFO skeptic.  Always have been.  He is a believer.  I usually roll my eyes and laugh at some of the things he's said he's seen in the past.  But this came out of nowhere.  We weren't looking for it.  We were trying to catch some bass.  No drinking or substances involved.  Just glad to be not at work with no obligations and fishing finally. We started the trip from the Portland Fairgrounds...  May or may not be entirely right to launch from where we did, but it was getting late and we wanted to get in.  Both of us have bright LED's that illuminate the surrounding water and trees.  We put the fishing off to head way down river (south).  I kept asking when we were going to be at this \"spot\" my friend had fished in the past.  Was a long trip down river.  Probably a few miles.  So when we saw what we both saw, we may have been near Portland, Cromwell, Rocky hill, Wethersfield, Glastonbury...  I'm not 100% sure.  But local fisherman have nicknamed the spot \"the peninsula\".  It's an island in the middle of the river near \"Perzold's Marine/Marina\".  We were heading to the back side the peninsula (downstream). Still in the middle of the CT river, We both saw something in the sky to the East.  It was bright white, big, crescent shaped, appeared suddenly and went down diagonally and to our left, moving very fast, until it disappeared behind the tree line.  We both said \"Whoa!\"  At the same time. We talked about it afterwards and I kept thinking of things it could've been but they all turned out to be impossible.  Closest I could think of would've been a comet or shooting star... But this was too big, too white, no tail, & too fast.  It happened very quickly and was gone. So we kept moving.  Our moment of wonder was soon replaced by the fact that we were at the peninsula and it was time to fish now.  My friend went to shore and started a fire on the beach area.  I kept paddling and casting near the shore for a bit before heading over.  I got out and we got a small fire going.  (Fire ordinances don't apply if you're in the middle of the river just before sunrise and don't know exactly what town you're technically in... right? Lol)...  Then it got wierd enough to remember for a long time and even report on here (I can't believe I'm doing this btw.)... I was standing by the fire.  For some reason I got the urge to look back over my right shoulder and up at the sky...  Why?  Because something was there.  That's the only reason I can think of why I'd look. I had already forgotten about the other event.  I looked up and saw a strange light moving a great distance at a medium pace, steadily in a straight line towards us across the sky (was heading west toward the Wethersfield side of the river.)  Things then escalated to wierd level 2: the thing had one bright light.  And as it got closer to being over head the light got dimmer and dimmer until it vanished completely. No clouds. Perfectly clear, still dark, just before dawn. It was gone. I turned my head back to my friend who was over on the left casting his line into the water. I quickly told him what I just saw and how wierd it was. He turned to look at me as I was talking. I looked up at the sky again and what we saw next made us both yell out profanities at exactly the ! same time. Diagonally In front of us, slightly northwest but just overhead, something shot across the sky faster than anything man made can move and in a way that stars, comets, or anything like that can move. This display, to me had \"technologically advanced machine\" written all over it. It made a line in the sky visible for less than a second. It was bright white and shaped like an archer's bow. Fast as hell and bright white. But this time, it didn't disappear afterwards. It looked as if it went hundreds of miles in a second to the north, and then stopped and hovered just above the tree line. And as it hovered it turned towrard us. And then it was possible to see more of its shape. It wobbled like a saucer as it turned toward us and then sat in a fixed position \"watching us\" as we fished. The front view it allowed us showed a multicolored string of lights around its cylindrical, saucer shaped perimeter. It say there for a while in the sky just before s! unrise, almost as if it was waiting for us to come to terms wi! th what we both saw, talk about it, and get comfortable with it to the point that we could just fish, know it's there, talk about it, and move on... Which is what we did basically. I've texted and talked about it with him in person since it happened just to verify the reality of it. I was completely blown away. There was no way I could dispute this or write it off as something else. He's happy because he \"won\", in that sense. But all I can think about now is wanting to see more. And I feel like a gift of knowing there's some other beings up there has been given to me. Pretty awesome. Next trip, I'll have my iPhone ready to take pics instead of tucked away in the watertight box I keep it in. Have even thought about getting a telescope. I'm amazed. That's all I can say. Thanks.",

It would look almost like a cross or a star at times, but it was clearly in the atmosphere. By a star I mean it would look almost how one would draw a star on a piece of paper like the religious symbol. Though it seemed to shift quickly and though the main source of light was tinny I thought I saw a blue light for a brief moment as well and there was an orange-ish color on the outer edge of the bright light.  I looked at it through a rifle scope and it definitely looked different sligh! tly magnified, but I still cannot put a finger on how I would accurately describe such a thing.  It might still be sitting there now.  I was playing the staring game with it for almost an hour and I lost and went inside.  I would hate to speculate, but the only three scenarios I can come up with of what something like this that just sits in the sky and slowly moves back and forth would be are either secret government technology, ET technology, or maybe even some type of inter-dimensional entity or spacecraft. I took a video of it. On camera it did not seem to look exactly the same while I was filming it but you could clearly see that it was sitting in one place while the planes were whizzing back and forth.",

     "text":"Red/orange lights seen for about 4 minutes in Western Pennsylvania About a half an hour ago, I was taking the dog out and looked at the west sky and noticed 2 bright orange/red dots about less than 2 inches away from each other ( if I were to stretch my hand and measure with my fingers, that is the distance I would get ).  The one on the top was slightly to the right in relation to the one on the bottom. They looked bright and big (size of Jupiter or slightly bigger) with a deep color of orange/red. As they began to move from left to right slowly, I tried to get a better view through the branches of the trees in my yard which were partially blocking the view. I was curious to find out if they were planets but once they began to move I thought it could be a plane. But then, 2 planes one on top of the other didn‚Äôt make much of a sense to me. So I called my husband to come outside and look at these lights. He came out and looked but was too concern on stepping on dog poop outside. It is cold tonight in the 40‚Äôs. So he came inside and didn‚Äôt want to bother being cold. I was still curious to find out what it was as the 2 lights continued to move from left to right. All of a sudden I see then 3 lights. If I were to connect the dots they would form a triangle in the sky about 4 inches apart from each dot. The color of the dots were exactly the same color as the other 2 lights. As this happened, I ran inside to call a friend of mine so she could go out and look at the west sky ! to see if she could see the same lights. The 3 lights began to move from left to right and instead of 3 dots I could only see 2 kind of horizontal lights from each other moving again from right to left (west to southwest). It seemed like the lights would move and stop.  The one far left kept going while the one on the right stopped and dimmed to no light at all.  I moved my position down the driveway toward the south so I could keep an unobstructed view of these 2 objects.  The light on the right continues to move slowly and more dimmed but I still could see it. All of a sudden the light that had dimmed before came back on with a white brightness just like a flood light shinning down and immediately dimmed to no light again.  It seemed like this light had appeared for 2 seconds disappearing again completely.  It was very cold and since I had no jacket, I just noticed the light from the left continue to move southwest and getting dimmer and dimmer.  After I called the center to re! port this sighting, I went up to my husband‚Äôs room to ask if h! e did or did not see any light. He told me all he saw was one red light.",

Time: Exactly 8:40 pm EST Date: Saturday, February 6, 2010 Meteorological Conditions: ‚ÄúSocked in‚Äù cloud cover, temperature in the mid-20‚Äôs. Rather bright out due to snow cover and cloud-refracted ground light. Objects Sighted: Three small, white orb lights, in triangular formation, also moving independently. Appeared as very bright stars, but BELOW the clouds. Duration of Sighting: Approximately 15 seconds. Driving to my friend‚Äôs house, exiting my neighborhood on a road that runs due west, 90 degrees to US Rt 219, I noticed three bright star-like lights in triangular formation ‚Äúparked‚Äù still in the sky in a southwesterly direction, about 50 degrees from the horizon line.  The lights were seen to my left, out the driver‚Äôs side window. Approximate altitude of lights was 2000‚Äô to 2500‚Äô.  I was instantly alarmed by this, considering the relatively low clouds, and they stood out plainly. I quickly noticed they were moving together, but suddenly they broke formation and began moving in tight, very quick elliptical maneuvers independently. This went on for about 8 seconds, before the ‚Äúlead‚Äù orb began heading SE. The other two lights stopped their maneuvers, and rejoined in formation behind the ‚Äúlead‚Äù orb. I could plainly see sky in between the objects, indicating they were indeed individuals and not one large triangle. All three were identical in size and brightness. Their velocity seemed the same, as no light moved faster than any of the others. I vocally exclaimed at this, as instinct and logic told me I was witnessing a UFO event. My brain scrambled to find another  explanation. The maneuvers were like that of a aerial dogfight, but all movements were rather fluid, albeit extremely fast and precise. These were much too small and fast to be even military aircraft. Also, the G forces being endured in such a craft must have been immense. Being someone who‚Äôs somewhat interested in the UFO phenomenon since a childhood sighting, I didn‚Äôt take my eyes off of them. There is no military air base near here, though the lights were in the airspace above our small local airport.  I happen to be an aviation enthusiast as well, and my eyes are often skyward, and I could tell these were no aircraft. They appeared as small, round lights, white in color, and rather bright like mini Christmas lights. I es! timate the size of the objects would be no more than 10‚Äô in diameter. Top speed was in the 200+ MPH range easily. As mentioned, they stood out because of the refracted light carried by the clouds, giving an illuminated sort of gray background to my sighting. I continued to watch at a stop sign as the lights maneuvered speedily back into their original triangle formation and proceeded southeast across Rt. 219 at great speed and gaining altitude until they faded out and disappeared through the clouds. There was a moderate amount of traffic, so perhaps I wasn‚Äôt the only witness. Anyone traveling south on Rt. 219 may have noticed.  I‚Äôd like to note that I‚Äôm a college graduate, and I consider myself educated, articulate, and very mentally aware of my environment. I cannot explain what I witnessed. Attached is a basic Photoshop rendering of the objects as they appeared prior to executing the elliptical maneuvers. This is also the same formation they returned to after.",

     "text":"A man and his two kids see a clear UFO less than a mile away during an autumn evening in Austin, Texas.  Dazed deer present. I‚Äôve had 6 sightings in my life, but none as good as this one. I had recently sold my car, where I kept a nice set of binoculars for the sole purpose of looking at a UFO closer if and when I saw another one, and was now driving the family van with my two kids on our way to get gasoline, and then to the store.   This particular evening was fairly clear, and, as I was driving down a slightly winding street to get onto a major street, I saw an orange object just above the tree line that, during the brief moment I had to see it, first made me think of the moon when it's low on the horizon and has an orange glow, the way it looks during an lunar eclipse.  However, I felt that the moon should be a bigger, and also that it wasn't in the direction of the sky where the moon usually is, so I looped around the other neighborhood streets and came back up the same street, slower, to get a second look. Sure enough, when I saw it again, there was no mistaking it, it was definitely a hovering UFO similar to one whose picture was taken on December 21, 1994, by Carlos Diaz, so I turned off my headlights, came to a stop where I had the best view, lowered the windows, and turned off the van. Believe me when I tell you that based on the terrain of this area, even though it's surrounded by houses, businesses, a high school, and a very busy major street, where this UFO was hovering was not observable except for about 50 yards on this one street where I was parked. I told my kids to look at the object, and told them it was a spaceship.  They were 3 and 5 years old at the time, and though innocent, they were very interested in hearing about a real spaceship, especially because they were fans of the movie Toy Story. The object was not a thin disk or cigar shaped.  Honestly, it looked a lot more like a slightly squashed lemon, except with two \"nipples\" on either side instead of a stem on one side and a nipple on the other.  It glowed a uniform orange, and it had white beacon lights, one on top, and one on the bottom, across its perpendicular axis.  It had a row of very small white lights across its horizontal axis, dividing the craft equally above and below.  The beacon lights were blinking about 3 times per second but not in sync with each other.  The object was about 3 stories off the ground, and less than a mile away from us, but I really can't estimate the exact distance.  I would say somewhere between half a mile and a mile.  I could not make out any more detail, and believe me; I REALLY missed not having my binoculars that day. I had a red laser pointer on me that I use at work, and my son asked me to point it at the object, but I ignored him.  He happened to have a flashlight that he'd gotten recently in his pocket, so before I knew it, he had taken it out and turned it on to point it at \"them\".  I moved his arm down, gently, but he could see I was being cautious.  He asked why I didn't want to signal them, and I said that I wasn't sure it was a good idea.  In my mind, I was thinking, \"I don't know if they are good or bad, and I don't want to inadvertently volunteer my kids to become regular abductees.\"  I was also thinking, \"Man, if only my kids weren't here, I'd get out of this van and run to get a closer look, but I'm trapped under these circumstances.\"  Anyway, to make a long story short, we watched this object for at least 3 minutes, and it was just hovering there, so in my impatience to get a closer look, I remembered a business parking lot that was adjacent (left of the object from our point of view) to the forest that this object was hovering over, and I thought, \"If I time the signal light properly, I can quickly race the van to make the left turn, go down a block or two into the business parking lot, and then drive to the edge of the parking lot closest to the object. Perhaps from there I can see it closer through the trees\", so without hesitating much, that's what I did.  As I raced the van and the trees blocked my view, the last glimpse I caught of the object was that it was still hovering in the same place, so I was very hopeful of being able to get a better look. However, when I got into the business parking lot, I found a big surprise - there were no less than 50, and probably more like 100 deer in the parking lot, and they were in a dazed, almost frozen state.  They moved very little, to the point that I had to steer around a few of them to avoid hitting them.  That in itself was remarkable, and only reinforced my belief that this object was not human-made, that the occupants had somehow put these deer in a trance.   After finally getting to where I thought I could see the object, I was disappointed to find out that I could not see it anywhere, so as fast as I could, again avoiding the deer in my way, I worked my way back to where I was before, and unfortunately the object was now gone.   After this event, my son drew a picture of what he saw, and it was essentially what I saw.  Both my children still remember the event, even though my daughter was so young, perhaps because we've retold it several times, but I certainly don't want them to forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I have the drawing somewhere in a box in the attic or inside a book, but I can't remember where exactly, and it's been over 7 years now since the incident.  If I ever run into it, I'll scan it and send it to you.   My apologies for not having kept better records.  I considered contacting an investigator from MUFON way back then to check woods below where the object was hovering, but I never did.  I was no willing to put my children in any type of danger. I still keep my eye out in the sky, so if I ever catch anything again, I'll also send it your way. ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

With binoculars, I observed two white-lighted objects, one above the other, shaped in opposite fan-shapes.  The two lights would work together, one above the other, and, at times, go back together as one.  The two \"lights\" would hover and vibrate for a moment in an area, swirl a flash of blue light or send a white streak out or flash a white or red dot somewhere on the perimeter.  It was as if the two ‚Äúwhite lights‚Äù were in the center of a larger object.  As it would hover, vibrate; send flashes or dots and then move slowly to the next area.  The object was always \"moving\"- meaning vibrating/hovering/flashing. It worked westward. There was no sound.  The evening was clear- minimal cloud cover and approx. 75 degrees. I spent from 3:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. watching from my balcony with small binoculars.  I sent a text message to a friend of mine and described it.  I attempted to get pictures and video, but the object was too far away and the sky too dark for my camera to be able to record. During this period, a small plane approached from the north, in a, what seemed, direct path with the object.  I observed the plane continue on its flight path, without changing direction, and fly directly \"below\" the object. (I am a poor judge of distance). After an hour, the \"lights\" had moved far enough west that I was unable to see them longer. I saw a similar object in May.  At that time it appeared that the \"star\" was \"hovering and moving\" and then suddenly and slowly, the star split into two perpendicular objects.  They began to flash a white light  independently- first the right, then the left.  There was no distinct pattern. There was no sound. The lights then stayed lit together and the object traveled slowly above the house and away to the east.  There was no sound. I am a single mother of two, have my MBA, and do not drink or do drugs.  Having very little time to myself, I enjoy a few quiet moments looking at the stars when I occasionally awaken during the night.  I have never seen objects look or behave in this manner previously.",

     "text":"Golden orb follows car, then changes into black triangle ufo, stops , and \"waits\" for them to pass close by. It was New Years day, 1998. Approximately 10:55 pm in Wisconsin, USA.  Three people were driving from Milwaukee to West Allis on a routine 20 minute drive to drop off a companion on a cold New Year's night. While on the apex of a bridge adjacent to an industrial area, the back passenger spotted a golden light, flashing at a rate of about 4 flashes per second, moderately high in the dark southwestern sky [see FIGURE 1]. It was about the size and color of a small, golden street light, fixed in the sky behind and to the left of the vehicle. The back-seat passenger alerted the driver and the front passenger to the peculiarity of the light, and they all thought it might be some sort of \"helicopter\" or \"star\". As there was hardly any traffic, the driver slowed the vehicle down between 10 to 15 mph.  The object conspicuously glided down towards the ground and closer to the observers. It ceased flashing and became a solid \"gold-light orb\" [see FIGURE 2]. Now seeming to be only a few blocks away to their left (west), it began to parallel the movement of the vehicle‚Äîkeeping up with its exact speed.. It was fairly low to the ground because it was somewhat being obscured by some thin tree branches (without leaves) along the roadside.  The vehicle, now having passed off the bridge, continued to move northbound towards a major intersection. As the driver slowed even more to get into the left-hand turn lane at a stop light, a red light rotated around the left side of the object, and then a blue light rotated around to the right side of the object. Both lights stopped at the visible edges and remained fixed at the object's respective sides for only a moment‚Äîdisappearing within seconds [see FIGURE 3]. At this point the object was moving at its slowest. Because of the sudden appearance of the ‚Äúpolice‚Äù lights and its speed, the witnesses concluded that it must be a police helicopter on a mission.  As the car sat at a complete stop in the left-hand turn lane, there were a few cars to the right of the vehicle. But people in those cars were not looking toward the object, which was traveling at a laborious pace very low to the ground (perhaps a 100 ft). It could barely be seen unless you were looking for it. As the object began to cross over the avenue they were going to turn onto (west), it now appeared to ‚Äúbranch out‚Äù into a string of five pale-white lights. It moved silently, almost at ‚Äúwalking speed‚Äù. The witnesses rationalized that it might be some sort of plane trying to make an emergency landing - but why land perpendicular to the street?  The lights suddenly stopped and became fixated directly above an estimated seven story factory building just two blocks away. The traffic light changed to green, and the driver finally turned left toward the object; it was just up ahead. No other cars or people were out on this usually busy street. Curiosity and perplexity filled the witnesses as they moved closer to the building.  Finally, the car pulled over to the side of the road. The back passenger rolled down his window and stuck his head out of the car to observe what could be resting in the sky above. The other two people strained to get a good view from the front passenger window. What seemed like a string of lights from a few blocks away on approach were actually the lights on the \"front\" and underneath of a large, black, equilateral triangle object. The five lights shown down like \"baseball stadium lights\", and were located at all three corners and in the middle of the two \"front\" sides [see FIGURE 4].  This large object was ‚Äúfixed‚Äù in the air, producing absolutely no noise, movement, or flashing. Everything around them seemed so still, almost like they were in a vacuum and ‚Äúweren‚Äôt supposed to be there.‚Äù The body of the triangle was colored charcoal-black, with a faint, grayish grove running along the front tip to the back center. There were visible sides: the edges showing a continuous grayish-black indentation with a slight overhang or lip. There also seemed to be very faint ‚Äúcircuit board‚Äù type etches on the body of the object. These apparent etchings were more apparent in the center grove on the ‚Äúbelly‚Äù of the triangle and within the groove or indentation along the sides. One witness later remarked that some of its features reminded him of a ‚ÄúStar Destroyer‚Äù space vehicle from the Star Wars movies.  After approximately 30 seconds of viewing the object, the driver became agitated and fearful, saying that they ‚Äúhave to get out of here.‚Äù He drove away and continued westbound on the avenue. When they left, the object left their point of view. But as they increased their distance at a block away, it came into view again in the back window, still fixated in the sky in the exact position last seen. Anyone else viewing the object might have passed and though nothing of it. It was so still and innocuous, that they probably would have thought it was part on the building complex. As the car passed over a hill a few blocks west of the object, it could not be seen any more. No other cars were observed on the road until about a half mile later.  The total experience was less than 5 minutes.  The three witnesses remained shaken for the rest of the night, with one of them insisting that it must be some sort of police helicopter performing a maneuver, and never wanting to talk about it again.  The most disturbing thing to the witness in the back seat was that even though he had been a big ‚ÄúUFO buff‚Äù from the time he was young, the word ‚ÄúUFO‚Äù or ‚Äúalien‚Äù never entered his mind until after the triangle was completely out of view. He even had other UFO related experiences before this, but still cannot explain why he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfreaking out‚Äù at the time. The best explanation was that ‚Äúhe was denying it in his mind to keep his body from freaking out.‚Äù  The strangest element to the whole experience was the apparent personal awareness the object had to the witnesses. It got their attention by flashing, moved in and followed alongside the vehicle at a distance, changed forms, and seemed to wait for them and them only. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))",

I was standing on the platform facing roughly west/northwest in the Copps Hill plaza on route 35 and observed an intensely flashing light hovering over the hill at about the height of what could be an airplane beacon.  There is a nearby municipal airport and so such a light might easily be overlooked.  As I watched the light for 30 or 40 seconds(it was flashing an intense array of red, green, white, silvery, and blue) it eventually dimmed over the course of about 3 seconds and began to flash just reddish-yellow, and after another 2 or 3 seconds began to move at a steady pace towards what I assume to be the south or southwest of its position, eventually disappearing behind a far hill in the distance in Westchester County, New York State.  I have observed many such lights over the years, always in the west over the hills of Westchester and Putnum counties and always with a similar pattern.  The lights will always be completely stationary and intensely flashing man! y colors, then either blink out of existence abruptly or after glowing just one color(usually red), or over the course of perhaps half a second the light will suddenly zoom off and disappear in a short arc in the shape of a parabola (like x squared from the origin to like x=4, that shape) and I stress they are always relatively low over the western hills where someone that isn't watching could easily overlook.

     "text":"Close Encounter and Sighting. In the summer of 2006, my then girlfriend and I were staying with my cousin.  Oddly enough, I used to live with him during my teen years, and being that he was in the military and then a city police officer, he had high powered lasers for his rifles etc. I can recall many nights sitting outside around 2002 and pointing this laser into the vast sky and thinking what if?  During this get together my cousin had there were many balloons but none with helium and definitely not any that would fit what I am about to tell you. I was outside smoking a ciggerette, we were not allowed to smoke in his house.  I glance over cause i see the still existing patch of woods swaying back and forth.  This was odd cause it was a dry and calm night with almost no wind. I walk toward the road and look to my right and up from the tops of the trees an almost colorless or reflective sphere seemingly floats out of the center of this wooded area. As I see this I immediately am drawn to it.  Saying to myself where did this balloon come from.  As I am watching, I realize this is no balloon. The sphere makes no sound, shows no propulsion mechanism and seems to actively reflect the color of the street light directly it and myself (orangeish/red).  As I keep trying to convince myself this is something earthly, I instantly felt connected with it as if it was intelligent or being controlled by some form of intelligence. I thought to myself, I have to get my girlfriend no one will believe this if I dont, then it moved in a hovering fashion about ten feet higher from where it was stationary above the power lines.  I mean this thing was like 35-40 feet above me and at one point as close as 20-30ft.  So I went over all the movie lines in my head about aliena once I sensed some sort of intelligent control from this object, like we come in peace and me thinking.  to it I will not hurt you what are you and in a sense, I swear it made me feel safe, empowered, watched over and took off literally in the blink of an eye. When it left from a hovering state it flew away ratjer slowly as if gaining.  Momentum but then it hit hyperdrive and cleared one end of the horizon to the other in milliseconds. The object up close was just noticeably 12-18 ft in diameter had no sound no lights and could.travel at beyond or near light speed. There is more what felt like dialogue during thus encounter and it would take an interview to really explain how amazing it was. Since my encounter, My knowledge has increased to a considerably higher status and I have survived a fatal car accident in which I bled out entirely and was helivacced to a specialised trauma unit.  I also have noticed what seems to be increased empathy or maybe a development of telepathy.  I really feel like I hear when someone is thinking, specifically in connection with them thinking of me and only in close proximity.  I swear this sounds crazy but I swear on the lives of my children I am telling you the truth. It's like I sense the things a person does not want to tell me, like I can hear their thoughts about me literally. I feel whatever it was it was other worldly and was visiting due to a signal that was an.accident on my part and took four and a half almost five years to get a reply for (me shining lasers with the aspiration of reaching e.t.)  It's like it knew or could hear me telepathically communicating the memory of me trying to send that signal cause i felt like its visit was my answer.  Yes we are here and Yea we hear your desire to communicate, obviously I had considered throwing things at it while it was hovering above me to see what it was.  Not movement no words just the thought of doing it made it move further away and then it flew away when I THOUGHT of getting someone else. There is so much more to this than I have time to type on my cell but I did want to report this. Also noted where I lived was next to an abandoned airport in my town that was right next my highschool. THE OBJECT BECAME THE SIZE OF A REGULAR STAR IN THE NIGHT SKY BEFORE I COULD EVEN BLINK. The distances it covered and way it traveled is unlike anything known to physically exist on earth.  Atleast publically but from there in cookeville it traveled north north east toward and obviously over livingston, tn and albany, ky direction. Also noted timeframe is fuzzy I would.have to ask my cousin what day he sold his.house and him and i do not speak. so this sighting/encounter may be related.to.others during that year. I'd like to think since then that I kind of have a guardian or witnessed a recon mission lol   Live long and prosper friends.",

A lazy night of television watching was interrupted when I heard a loud plane flying outside my window.  I tried to ignore the sound until several minutes had passed and it still had not subsided.  I decided to investigate and went out on my 2nd floor balcony, which faces northwest, only to find nothing within my viewing range and the sound fading to nothing.  Directly across from my balcony is another condo complex, approximately 75-100 feet away.  The two run parallel and there is a long grassy lane that runs between them.  I have a good view of the northwest sky and an extremely bright star (I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs called, but it isn‚Äôt the north star because it moves beyond my viewing area late at night.)  I decided to smoke a cigarette while I was outside, and after several minutes I could see two objects in the distance, which I thought were planes because I could see red and white lights.  I continued to smoke until I noticed that the lights were closer and appeared to be much lower in the sky than I originally thought.  I watched the lights move toward me, to the south, and when the closest one broke the plane of the twilight, the silhouette I observed appeared to be a black sphere shape with 4-5 lights on it.  I did not hear any sound or see any headlights or green lights, and I my adrenaline was pumping as I tried to make sense of what I was seeing.  I live near SFO Airport, so planes are regularly flying overhead.  I then noticed that the second set of lights also appeared to be on a sphere shaped craft and both craft were flying in the same direction at approximately the same altitude.  I watched as both craft appeared to fly in a straight line due south until they passed out of my view.  As I lit up another cigarette, I reflected on what had occurred and attempted to logically explain what I had seen.  Not even two minutes later, something else caught my eye further north.  A triangular craft that appeared to be slightly larger than the spheres came into view from behind a tree.  It looked black (but it was difficult to tell with the twilight fading) and it had the same red and white lights, but the white lights seemed to be arranged in a rectangle from my viewpoint.  I didn‚Äôt notice any sound, although I may have been too distracted to notice.  I watched it head slowly toward the direction of the two spheres flight path.  As it passed out of view, I frantically tried to call friends that lived south of me, but none of them picked up.  I genuinely hope that someone else saw this or can explain what I did see, because after talking with my friends, I know that I won‚Äôt be able to talk to people about this without some kind of corroboration.  I have no photos and no other witnesses where present, just an unbelievable story.",

     "text":"Two large, brightly lit oval disks seen from West Seattle South over Puget Sound On the evening of July 22nd I was on the deck of our home in West Seattle and my husband was upstairs.  Our home sits facing south on the cliff above Puget Sound at an elevation of 328 feet.  It was 8:50 PM and the sun was setting. I looked out across Puget Sound to the south past Lincoln Park toward Tacoma and saw two large, hovering, rotating, oval-shaped crafts with very bright white lights that were flashing and twinkling. They were in formation and the one to the right looked to be further away.  From my vantage point, they were about ¬æ the size of a full moon or larger.  Standing in the exact location if I extend my first finger the objects were as wide as my nail and ¬Ω  to ¬æ of the length of the nail.  Based on the altitude and the jet planes I see daily on the flight path I estimated that 3-4 large passenger jets could have fit inside. The lights were significantly brighter than the West Seattle-Vashon ferry which was traversing below (east to west) as well as the lights on the jet plane that was traveling south on the flight path (to the southwest) and the red aviation towers that are visible to the southwest of our house.  They looked like light reflecting off a diamond on a much larger scale. The location was just to the right (west and south) of Lincoln Park from my view and just above the land on the horizon. I could hear the jet and the disks/ ovals were noiselessly hovering and rotating slowly. I quickly got my binoculars and observed a dark black outline of the oval disks.  There were no wings, no propellers, and no landing gear with very bright light radiating from the center. I watched them for 3-5 minutes at which point the one to the right began to tip and turn to the left slowly like it was going to leave.  I could see the dark underside which was oval shaped.  As it turned, the bright light faced to the southeast but I couldn‚Äôt see the other side of it, just the underside which appeared black. I went upstairs and handed the binoculars to my husband who then watched them for 3-5 minutes.  He attempted a picture through the binoculars with his iPhone but the resolution was not good enough.  Each disk slowly tipped to the right and departed to the southwest, slowly disappearing from sight.  As they turned the lights shone the other direction and the disks appeared black. I‚Äôve lived and worked as an acupuncturist in Puget Sound for 17 years and have never seen anything like this. I have sat on my deck or near our many south facing windows for the last 2.5 years and am familiar with all the Sea-Tac airport traffic, military planes and helicopters, have seen meteors and comets, but I have never seen anything like this.  The aircraft technology was more advanced than I have ever witnessed.",

     "text":"Two objects over West Palm Beach Florida. One changed shape and both disappeared Approximately 9am 11/2/2009 I received a call from two of my workers on a job site claiming they saw two UFO's. They asked if I could see them from where I was. Not able to locate the UFO's I drove about 10 minutes to their location where I saw my two workers and about a dozen residents of the location on the 2nd floor of a high rise condo looking up. They described two objects, one bright red the other white, neither one blinking. One sitting still white the other circling. I always carry binoculars with me and was able to locate the two objects they described. The two objects were directly overhead, very high in the sky but their exact height was difficult to determine as there were no clouds, blue sky and no other aircraft in the area to allow proportion. My first thought was that the objects were lost helium balloons but it was unusual that one was motionless and and stationary while the red object seemed to drift away from the white object. After several minutes the red object drifted back toward the white object, follow a semi circle around the white object, drift away then disappear. Convinced these were balloons I left the jobsite, residents still looking skyward, drove about a mile, stopped my truck, called my wife who was about 5 miles from my location to see if she could see the remaining object. Not having a clue as to how large an object this was or how high I figured if she could see it that far away then a) we weren't imagining anything or b) the object obviously had some size to it. After telling her where to look she spotted it also. We both watched for about 15 seconds, her naked eyes and me though my binoculars when the object started getting very bright, change from a spherical shape to a more elongated cigar type shape, get very fuzzy or almost mirage-like then disappear. My wife described exactly what I was viewing through the binoculars. My workers radioed the same exact description. The object,which appeared to be white then silverish blinked, got very bright, dimmed, became elongated then fuzzy then disappeared. I tried to use my camera phone to record it but the objects were too high to get any type of accurate recorded visual. Also tried to place the lens of the camera phone up to the binocular eyepiece, which sometimes works but the objects were too difficult to locate. The entire sighting was about 20 minutes.",

     "text":"((NUFORC Note:  Source of report describes self as an \"M.D..\"  We do not know the precise dates of the alleged incidents, described below, and find it unusual that NUFORC has not received reports about the alleged sightings before now.  PD)) Multiple-type UFOs are witnessed multiple times, in multiple states, near U.S.A.F. bases in LA and CO. Several other individuals and me have been observing clandestine military \"UFOs\" for approximately five years now. Two to four distinguishable crafts have been observed during this time period. The locations I speak of are Shreveport, Louisiana area and the Denver, Colorado cosmopolitan center and Bailey, Colorado, approximately 45 miles south of Denver. Both in Shreveport and in Colorado, United States Air Force Bases are nearby. In Colorado the sites are the U.S. Air Force Academy plus NORAD within Cheyenne Mountain in and near Colorado Springs. In Shreveport, Louisiana, the site is Barksdale Air Force Base.  I will first comment on the history of others and my observations. Beginning in 2003, my brother, a friend and me began seeing large, glowing and color-changing objects over Lake Bistineau in Bossier Parish about 20 miles from Shreveport and near a very small rural town called Hall Summit. Periodically, on a darkened road very near Hall Summit, LA, my brother and I (and occasionally others brought along)witnessed several aerial crafts in the night sky and depending on the evening of observation, one or more different crafts were observed. Typically, the activity in this country area peaked in the late AM hours, before dawn. However, there was some activity as long as it was dark. The most prominent and constantly witnessed UFO was a large, bright orange oval object in the sky which was capable of hovering, moving at an variable speeds, none of which were considered to be \"high-speeds,\" as seen in LA, anyway. These identical crafts were also seen hovering above the lake named above with the same light/shape configuration and rapid color changing properties. These \"color-changers\" were discoid in shape, appeared metallic and when viewed by high-magnification binoculars They all moved from side-to-side or if viewed from directly below,they made small concentric circles as if their propulsion was possibly related to the harnessing of the earth‚Äôs own (geo)electromagnetism as the movements were identical to that of two magnets of opposing poles when brought close together. The propulsion of these type crafts were silent. The most often seen color was orange, however, all colors of the visible spectrum were viewed at varying times; often the type of craft mentioned cycled through this spectrum rapidly.  The \"color-changers\" were often but not always associated with faster moving crafts we termed \"strobers\" as they displayed strobe-like qualities flashing intense bluish-white light at extremely high frequency when moving and a slower frequency when  approaching a landing area on government land, in the middle of virtually zero population. They were difficult to look upon as a prolonged gaze requires.Their propulsion was, too, silent. These crafts \"buzzed\" our vehicle at a very low altitude while stationary or when driving--multiple times over the years. I cannot comment on the shape of these crafts, due to the light intensity. These were much smaller than the above crafts that appeared at least 100-200 ft.in diameter and were rarely witnessed hovering except as they were about to land. They were capable of high-speed maneuvers such as small angle turns and abrupt stops and change of direction without deceleration. These accounts of the aerial ships seen in the country were near government owned land and is inaccessible. One evening at about 4:00 AM CST while driving on a small rural highway nearby, an orange-glowing \"color-changer\" passed over us at a very low altitude (150-200 ft. perhaps) and my bother and me were within 1 mi. of our usual observation point and we sped there, eyeing the orange ship until we reached our stationary observing position. The huge craft proceeded to land about 1000 to 2000 yards away. Two \"strobers\" buzzed by us as the larger craft passed over us toward its landing spot. Upon landing, either the orange ship‚Äôs lights were turned off or it proceeded underground. Too, we had seen lower hovering crafts \"cloak\" or shutting down their lights.These UFOs seem to be of military association. Gasoline? Free energy appears to have been harnessed.  In Denver and Bailey CO, the hovercrafts (\"color-changers\") were seen yet in massive numbers, at higher altitudes and typically emanating only bluish-white light. The same small movements--as if magnetically-related propulsion was used--were identical to the ships in LA. An extremely large hoverer appeared over the same mountain peak nightly and the intensity of its white light was remarkable. It was viewed from a much greater distance (~1.5-2 mi.)and using the LA crafts as a reference,was at least 1000 feet across. In Bailey, (not seen in LA) the crafts at higher altitudes often zipped away with no apparent acceleration and, too, could stop on a dime. On an average evening, barring unfavorable weather conditions, there were 30-40 of these objects scattered in the sky. Other times there were much fewer present. They were over the urban area of Denver, also, at relatively low altitudes.  I have not returned to the country viewing area in LA for several years. Now, the same \"color-changing‚Äô discoid crafts hover over Shreveport proper, a few at higher altitudes and typically one or two at lower altitudes. The lights however appear to remain white. While hovering, if viewed from binoculars, rapid color changes are seen. Many I know have witnessed these crafts and agree they are presumably military. The last time I spent time observing one of these was April 30, 2007, with a friend, within the city, from my front porch. Their presence in the evening sky is constant. The sightings are regular yet the crafts over the city do not maneuver, they just hover and make their small nutated  movements. The fact I‚Äôve read absolutely  no reports of these highly visible \"UFOs\"  is incredible to me. They need to be evaluated by experts with the proper equipment and brought to the largely unknowing public‚Äôs awareness given the potentiality for a cheap or free energy source. They are obviously higher aerial technology that has been disclosed and I feel as though they are at least partly used for surveillance/security. They fall under the definition of a UFO as they are not identified.  Two other type crafts were witnessed in the country, both similar: rectangular shuttle-like crafts heading in the direction of the Air Force base. Propulsion could be heard (a low uniform hum); these were of such a low-flying altitude (~60 ft.) that 6 (on one of these crafts) to 8 (on the other)circular propulsion devices were viewed beneath each \"shuttle.\" Windows were present on the crafts' front which were very small and rectangular. Side windows were large and square with yellow light inside seen along with human shaped figures near the windows. There were no exterior lights present on either and an estimated speed of both is 40-50 mph: an atypical, very slow speed for an object of their size and apparent weight. The rectangular humming crafts appeared 40-50 ft.long by 15 ft. wide.  The high level of activity in the region warrants investigation. I have seen the same hover-type crafts not only in the two locations mentioned but everywhere I have traveled within the U.S. I am an M.D. and a trained observer. To let this slip by without investigation would be tantamount to continuing to allowing the government and its military to fund and operate these specialized crafts without inquiry and to continue to use hidden, inexpensive propulsion, likely in most cases presented above, to be geo-electromagnetism harnessed and likely regenerated--for free.  (You may contact me by email (or by written mail or phone if requested).",

So bright it almost was blinding as I was sitting in the Hot Tub. My Friend‚Äôs Birthday was that day and she was there to also witness it after I pointed it out to her. After 30 seconds or so we seen this Long Rounded at both ends no wings no Tail, no Chemtrail (Smoke) that I could see, and no Wire or antennas plus just real \"LONG!\" I didn‚Äôt see any writing of any sort. It seemed to be moving slow or just gliding through the air, but at that size and bulk it could have been going much faster.  It seemed to be solid and a bit metallic white. There was also no noise that it made. This Cigar shaped craft was flying really low. It was 70-85 feet in the air just over the tops of the tallest trees The Tallest trees being 45-50 feet tall. It was a sight no one would forget. I watched this craft for 4 and half minutes! Watching it with my friend. It was around 5:40 pm.. There were only a few clouds, and when it reached a cloud as I watched it go behind the cloud, and waiting for it to reappear it just was gone. No it wasn‚Äôt a plane or a Blimp, Weather balloon, or swamp gas. Any more information would be wonderful. Thank you.  I have also seen this craft before with my sister but she refuses to get involved. Hope this helps.",

     "text":"Saw 2 objects in broad daylight within 20 minutes I was in this area from out of state visiting relatives.  On this Saturday afternoon, I was running some errands with my 4 year old son, driving east on Old Hwy 94, when I looked to the north and saw a vertical white cylinder cruising from west to east.  It appeared to be about 3/4 of a mile away and at about 2000-2500 feet above ground.  Its proportions were about 1 to 5, so I guess it was about 6' wide by 30' tall. It was moving steadily at a speed equal to or greater than that of a twin engine propeller-driven airplane, so I would guess 150-200 mph.  I worked my way through an intersection and then pulled to a stop in a parking lot for a better look.  This thing cruised and then quickly slowed to a complete stop, where it hovered for maybe 10 seconds, then traveled straight up at about half it's previous speed for about 1000 feet, then stopped and hovered for maybe 30 seconds, then began accelerating to the east again at 150-200 mph.  I watched its departure until it went out of sight.  It remained very bright white the whole time, and as it moved, it never looked thinner or flashed brightly as if it had edges, so I think it was a cylinder.  The sky was sunny with a broken ceiling of alto-cumulus clouds, with moderate winds out of the west.  The object remained below the clouds.  The object was traveling with the wind, but maneuvering unlike a balloon or anything else.  I continued with my errands, constantly looking up to the sky as I drove around town.  After a few minutes, I stopped at a Sonic drive-in for lunch and parked so that I could look to the north-west.  I began eating my lunch while looking up through the windshield, and was rewarded almost immediately (this was 20 minutes later)when I saw a dark round object flying from west to east.  I got out of the car for a better look and saw as it was approaching and then passing almost directly above, that it was round when viewed from below and a flattened oval when viewed from the side.  It was shaped just like a glass piece from the game \"Pente\".  This object was bronze-colored (a dark blend of green, brown and gold).  As it made distance, I could see that the top was highly refective of the sun.  I wanted to rule it out as a toy balloon, but it wasn't.  As it traveled, I gained a sense of its approximate height and distance and surmised it was not small and low to the ground, but higher, larger and faster.  It wobbled as it flew; listing 20-30 degrees but never flipping end over end.  I would guess it was at about 1000' above ground and maybe 8'-12' in diameter.  I later called the St. Louis FAA Fight Service Station which offers detailed weather conditions for pilots.  The briefer told me that at that time the cloud ceiling was at or above 5000' above ground, the winds aloft at 3000' were at 18 knots (approx. 20 mph) from the west.  This told me that although both objects were traveling with the wind, they were cruising on their own power 8 to 10 times faster than the wind could push them.  I feel lucky to have seen these things, but returned to the family reunion not saying a damn word about it.  I'll tell my son about it when he's older and will look up to the skies a lot more often.  I am 45 years old, a private pilot and I work as an architect.",

     "text":"On 08/16/14, three witnesses observed large orange fireball traveling South to North-Northeast over Phoenixville, PA. On Saturday August 16, 2014, at approximately 9:00PM (EST), I was returning home to Northridge Village (Townhouse Community) in Phoenixville, PA, with my girlfriend when we observed my neighbor walking two dogs and standing in the middle of the street/lane that led to my driveway.  She appeared to be shocked by something and had forgotten about the dogs until I slowed almost to a stop; she then reined the dogs in to give my car room to pass by.  I drove into my garage and then my neighbor called me over to show me something in the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a large, very bright orange fireball object moving in a straight line away from our position heading North-Northeast.  My girlfriend then came out to meet us and observed the object as well. My neighbor stated the object had come from the South directly towards her at a very low altitude.  She stated that right when I was turning in to pass her, the object changed direction just as it was above my neighbor‚Äôs house which is directly behind mine.  She repeatedly commented on how low the object was flying towards her (I later asked her if it was as high as a commercial plane flying at approximately 5,000 feet that was very distinguishable and she said the object had been much lower).  I asked her if she could make any features out on the object before it changed direction and she stated that it was circular. We watched the fireball object continue on its flight path for approximately 20-30 seconds until it appeared to gain significant altitude and eventually appear like other stars in the sky before finally winking out of view.  I estimate the object‚Äôs distance to us at the closest point of approach to have been approximately 3-5 miles away.  There were a few commercial aircraft visible during the flight of the fireball object and immediately after it disappeared.  Regardless of altitude, all of the commercial aircraft displayed lights and a few of them could be heard.  The orange fireball object displayed no lights and made no sound despite the high velocity at which it appeared to be traveling across the sky (I would estimate at least 4-5 times the speed that you would observe a commercial airline pass overhead).  It also did not have any type of visible tail or vapor trail despite its high rate of speed. Approximately a minute after the orange object disappeared, my girlfriend was discussing the object with my neighbor when I observed a blue and white light approximately 600-700 yards away, above the wooded area adjacent to our community.  It was bright (it reminded me of a firework) and falling towards the ground.  It was visible for about 2-3 seconds before it disappeared.  We discussed the fireball object and what it possibly could have been with my neighbor for a few minutes and then went home. At approximately 10:00PM (EST), I stepped out onto my deck to watch the sky to see if I would see anything else.  After about five minutes, I saw another bright object traveling from the south toward my position (it was nowhere near as close as the first object so I could not discern any additional characteristics).  I could immediately tell it was not a typical commercial aircraft so I called out to my girlfriend to come look and we both grabbed our iPhones in case it approached close enough to try to record it.  The object appeared to be approximately 12-15 miles away and had not yet reached Phoenixville.  As my girlfriend was trying to ready her iPhone to record video, her flash came on for a few seconds.  At the same time the object changed its flight path approximately 110 degrees to its starboard and flew due east.  It remained visible for only a few more seconds before disappearing. We then turned and looked back towards the direction the original object had traveled in and observed what was possibly a third object on the horizon above the wooded area adjacent to our community.  It was too far away and only visible for about 5 seconds, making it impossible to determine what it might have been. I then went inside to conduct some research and confirmed that the Perseids meteor shower had been most active between August 9th-14th; however, these meteors were supposed to appear to come from the constellation Perseus which was North of my house at the time of incident and not from the South like we observed.  Additionally, most Perseids are estimated to disappear in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere at heights above 50 miles.  The object we observed with my neighbor was significantly lower.  The object also did not leave a tail as one might expect if it were a meteor.  I also have never heard of a meteor that suddenly changed directions, let alone one that gained altitude until it disappeared. I next came across a similar incident that had occurred in the vicinity of Maisfield Road in Phoenixville, PA.  The recollections of that person‚Äôs observations were eerily similar to what we saw.  That incident occurred on December 23, 2013.  I did not find anything to indicate there was any type of meteor shower or other phenomena during that time frame.  If anyone is interested in my account, I would strongly advise you to read about this incident as well as it appears to possibly be the same type of object. We also discussed the possibility of the object being some type of rocket, but again there was no visible tail and no sound despite the high rate of speed.  Additionally, my girlfriend and I had observed the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) probe launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia from our house on September 6, 2013 and it was a totally different experience than the fireball object we observed.  The NASA rocket launch had a clearly defined tail and was without a doubt much, much farther away.  I do not know of any rockets that would fly so low, yet leave no vapor trails and make no sound. A third theory was discussed of the object possibly being a Chinese lantern or some other balloon type object.  My opinion is the object was too large and bright to be either and that the sheer speed that it moved at (4-5 times faster than the visible planes in the sky) would preclude it from being such an object. Lastly we discussed the possibility of the object being some type of drone or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), possibly out of Willow Grove Naval Air Station (NAS).  I have never seen a drone in flight, but I do not believe it would be bright orange at night to attract unwanted attention, nor that it would not make any noise if breaking the sound barrier.  According to local media reporting, Willow Grove NAS does not physically launch/recover any drones; the base is used only as a remote controlled command location.  The object we observed at close range was circular and did not resemble any known types of UAVs. I have 13 years of military/law enforcement experience and have worked in environments where I have observed numerous types of military aircraft in operation.  I have also spent many nights out on the open ocean thousands of miles from any land observing the night sky and constellations.  I have never seen anything like the bright orange fireball that I saw on the 16th and I cannot at this point even venture a guess as to what it might have been.",

I am a new mother and skeptic of ufos, but what I witnessed last night has made me a believer!  As usual, I was outside smoking a cigarette after getting my baby to bed.  I live in the country, so the night sky is pretty visible due to lack of city lights.  My husband and I witnessed 3 unknown crafts over a 3 hour period.  Two of which blinked red and white, while the other was a bright orange(also flew much closer then the other two).  The first object was spotted just above the horizon in the distance.  It appeared as an airplane with a red light, approaching quickly at first, then slowly began to rise into the sky while blinking red and white.  The red light appeared to be moving in circular motion around the craft as it hovered.   At around 4 am (an hour later), a second craft approached.  This craft appeared to have a long cigar like shape with orange illuminating light.  It appeared just south of us right above the neighboring tree line, flew low and quickly eastward, then disappeared low in the tree line miles away.  When this craft flew near us, we could hear dogs from 3 different houses begin to bark wildly.  Finally a third light appeared, flashing red and white like the first craft, following the same flight pattern as the first. Both lights were still visible hovering in the sky at 6 am when the sun began to rise.  These crafts made no noise and gave me a very uneasy feeling. I was unable to take my eyes off the hypnotic lights.  I lost sleep thinking about what I had just witnessed, and feared  that I could no longer deny ufos exist.  These objects were certainly not airplanes, Chinese lanterns, nor were they any sort of drone.",

     "text":"Unexplained light in night sky changes color before disappearing. Earlier this year I had a sighting of an aerial object from my house was mthat aybe not so incredible, but unexplained nonetheless. This sighting took place at approximately 9pm from my home in Sarasota, Florida. I was outside on my deck talking on the phone with a friend when I spotted an unusaul white light in the night sky at just about a 45 degree angle traveling at a slow, steady speed, at what looked like a linear path approaching me from the South in a North or Northeast heading. This light was about the size of a pencil eraser or around 3x the size of the brightest star Sirius, but not as brilliant.  I asked my friend if he could see anything and he confirmed he did.  He was about 12 miles Northwest of me in the neighboring town of Bradenton.  He was further from the object than I was and it would have been lower in the horizon from his point of view, but he still had an unobstructed view since the land here is completely flat.  He was excited like myself, and urged me to bring out my telescope to have a closer look. I wanted to but I did not want to miss anything, and I was afraid the object would have disappeared by the time I set up my telescope (about 2 minutes time in a hurry). Both of us agreed this was not a Satellite, much too large and traveling too slow at what appeared to be an altitude of 10,000 ft. or so, definitetly not orbital. I also ruled out a helicopter because there was no sound. I still had not ruled out a possible large aircraft on approach to Sarasota/ Bradenton airport. It was not far off the appoach path commercial jet airliners take, and so I thought it might be the nose and wing lights appearing as one light head on, as they often do.  As the light traveled east of me and I was looking at it from the side, this now seemed unlikely. In addition, there were no red and green navigation lights, and again there was no sound.  After 3-4 minutes of this white light traveling in the sky, it suddenly changed to a red color! The best way I could describe it was the white light was extinguished and turned to a more subduded deep red color. It appeared to continue to travel in the same direction and speed. This lasted for maybe 5-10 seconds and then it disappeared all together. I immediately asked my friend to describe what he saw, and he collaborated what I just witnessed. We couldn't believe it! I continued to scan the skies for several more minutes, but saw nothing further.  Summing this up, I witnessed a large white-lighted object for a duration of approximately 4 minutes, traveling in the night sky at a slow rate of speed, then suddenly turning red before disappearing. The light was always steady, not strobed. Impossible to make out a shape of the object behind the light. There was no sound.  I consider myself a competent sky observer, having a pretty good knowledge of aircraft and the night skies. I'm 44 years of age and this is the first and only time I have ever observed a light in the sky that I could not explain to my satisfaction. This event happened earlier this year in February and apologize for submitting this late, but I thought it worthwhile. At the time of this sighting, I did in fact check the online submitted UFO reports and local newspaper to see if this strange light had been reported by anyone else here in Sarasota area, but I did not find anything.

     "text":"Two silvery-white circular shaped craft appeared to use a cloaking technology to reappear and disappear. Hello. I am the same guy that reported the sighting on August the 2nd after leaving the Glasgow Park. This time I was on the deck of my backyard during the brewing of the late afternoon thunderstorms that were quickly covering Northern Delaware around 5-6 PM Eastern Time.  I was sitting on my deck watching the clouds swirl as there appeared to be one frontal system coming from a Southwestern direction that was bisected by another from a Southeastern direction.  As I stand on my deck watching the clouds move with grace and speed, I noticed in the distance at what appeared to be a great altitude, maybe that of what you would typically see inbound and outbound flights appear at, but just under the main cloud layer that was forming. They were a silvery white colored and my initial thought in trying to recognize what these 2 objects were is that it may have been 2 seagulls flashing their white underbelly as the sung shines a reflection from it to my direction. Howe! ver, what happened next lead me to believe these were not birds or traditionally inbound, outbound passenger airliners as they disappeared as if they were cloaking for 2 seconds and then they reappeared in the next breath to only disappear for good after a few more seconds (another 2 to 3).  They were flying in the general direction that the storm system was heading, a Northeastern direction (they were following the frontal system that was coming from the southwest).   Both of these objects were far from where I was standing, from what I could tell but they were tightly grouped together. They did not zig or zag, they merely were flying in what appeared from my parallax as a straight pattern toward a northeast direction. Maybe due to the sunlight's distortion or other exogenous factors, the crafts appeared to be silver at first but then they appeared to be more of a pure white color. I did not see any flashing lights, just merely the objects themselves. And as for the shape o! f the craft, they were a spherical or circular fit. I did not ! see any visible wings, but that does not mean there weren't any wings b/c from my vantage point, I was quite far. The reason I decided to report this is b/c of the peculiar cloaking and reappearing nature of these crafts. I have never seen any aircraft ever do this to my knowledge. As to the specifics of weather, it was not quite raining yet, it was cool outside due to the coming frontal system, daylight was still visible although it was quickly dimming due to the dark cloud systems forming, and this is my 2nd late evening sighting within 3 days. Also, the objects left no visible contrails and I did not hear any audible jet or engine noise.",

One, the first, was so similar to the 6/9/17 Boulder, CO, report, that I have been moved to recount it here. In my original report, I described two types of orbs, one brilliant white that appeared as a metallic disc upon arcing miles away in a second or two, then pausing before disappearing straight away.  Another orb, deep reddish orange, smooth-surfaced, glowing darkly, appeared at the end of the event.  I now am thinking it may well have been the same craft!   After the initial sighting, with the object having arced away from a standstill corresponding to my fearful reaction, and while I was feeling bad for having only seen it so briefly, I think it came back, only this time it was moving slowly beneath the clouds erratically shining a beam up into the clouds along with a red pulsing light, still overwhelmingly brilliant white orb of light otherwise.  It disappeared into the clouds. Some moments later the reddish orange dark glowing orb appeared just hovering up in a pocket under cloudy outcropping  directly above me until the clouds enveloped it. Wish I knew what they were.
