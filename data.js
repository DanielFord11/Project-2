It fell as if falling from an invisible opening in the sky... the night was a crystal clear night sky  so no clouds or precipitation to obstruct our view and the object was closer than any I have ever witnessed before. The way the object fell was too slow to be a meteor or falling star, also noting that there was no ‚Äúlight trail‚Äù following behind the object as it fell. We watched it fall for about 5 seconds before it disappeared into the dark night sky somewhere close to the earth surface.  It was the strangest light; object; ufo... I have encountered and felt a duty to report it.",

   "text":"BLACK CUBE UFO. It was a rainy night that night.  I work in a data center so I get off late at night.  Around 2:30am, I am standing outside smoking a cigarette.  The rain had subsided, but there were still strong winds being blown around in all directions.  I was speaking to a buddy on the phone looking out into the night sky.  The clouds were hanging low and the street lights were giving the clouds an eerie orange glow.  It also lit up the sky.  I caught something out of the corner of my eye moving from the North.  I am facing due West at this point.  It was just under the clouds and moving at a good pace, about 100mph if I were to guess.  It was traveling South just above 75 Central Expressway.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen, or may ever see in my life.  It was a black cube 80-100ft tall.  I was awe-struck.  I really sat and took in the moment even with my friend on the phone.  I knew this was special.  It didn't make a single noise and was about 500ft off the ground.  It literally looked like it was carved out of a rough black stone.  There were no lights to speak of.  There were no pipes or anything industrial on the outside of the craft. When the craft was directly in front of me I could clearly see the details.  The side facing me was framed on the edge.  I mean that it had a line carved into the stone that ran the entire edge of the side.  Within the framed edge was a circular pattern.  It was obvious to me that it was a deliberate pattern.  I can only say that it would take an understanding of mathematics to create the circle.  As it went from my right to left, North to South, it left a vapor trail that swirled in the disturbed air behind it.  Like I said, it made no sound.  It was absolutely huge.  The rain started to come down again as it left my sight.  I immediately told my friend to go outside as he was South of my location.  He waited out in the middle of his street for 20 minutes looking for it. He was never able t! o see it as conditions worsened with the rain.  I cannot stop ! thinking about this incident now.  I cannot stop looking for this craft.  It is monumental in terms of what kind of an impact this has had on my life.  This changes everything.",

   "text":"((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous source.  No dates provided.  PD)) Sightings of Cube, Triangle, Cigar, Diamond  ships over Winchester Massachusetts (near Boston) I have seen several objects which I believe may be UFO's.  I live on the flight path into Logan Airport in Boston and observe normal aircraft all the time on approach and take-off.   I also live near Hanscom Air Force Base and have observed military planes landing and taking off.  In the past few years I have been stargazing, when all of the sudden, some very bright objects high up in the sky will appear and seem to hover over the Boston area in the sky for a couple of hours.  I observed one of these objects very closely once for a few hours before it seemed to move away.  I used binoculars for a better look. The objects were very bright and very slow moving, but I could tell that they were moving slowly back and forth all over the sky.  It took several minutes for the object to cross the sky.  Then it would change corse and move a different direction for a while.  I looked through the binoculars and also when I squinted my eyes I could make out a triangular shape to the  bright object, and I thought with the binoculars I could make out some flashing lights on the ends of the points of the triangle and even a brightly lit cockpit area. (the object was small and very bright as if it was high up above the earth) Well above the aircraft routes.  It seemed to be observing us.  I have since taken more notice to the skies than in the past and have noticed several times some diamond and triangular objects and even a cube and cigar shape once.  They are all very high up but below the stars and above the planes.  They all move very slowly - and I do not know how to explain it.  But the object is too far away to be a plane and doesn't move fast enough, and too big from the viewpoint to be a star.  The fact that it moves slowly across the horizon and shifts position occasionally rules out that it is a star or planet. I do not know how to explain it except its a UFO.  All of these sightings in the past few years have been in winchester from my house.  But I did also see a cigar shape object with flashing multicolored lights pass overhead in Cooperstown New York.  It was the oddest thing I have ever seen.  And this one actually changed speed.  It moved slowy at first picked up speed, shifted positions, then finally sped off.  But it was moving much faster than a plane or military jet and was too high to be a plane.  And too bright and large to be a star/planet.

   "text":"When we lived in Kansas in the early 1960s, we as small children made forts in the wheat. We would stomp the wheat down to make square rooms, round and rectangular shaped rooms and we would connect the room together with hall ways.  One night I looked out of the kitchen window and saw a White cube that glowed like a light bulb.  It had a red light glowing on the inside of it.  The area was north of Great Bend, Kansas. There are or were quite a few radio towers there and one huge TV 2 tower.  The cube shaped thing flew around that radio tower like a moth flies around a light bulb of all things, only slower than a moth and it never hit the tower.  I ran to the bath room to get my dad but he said don't brother him.  So I ran back to the kitchen yelling for my two brothers to come here.  When I got back to the window it was still flying around the tower.  Just before my brothers got to the window it came across the field towards me in a blink of an eye it was hovering around 75 feet above the ground.   That is when my two brothers made it to the window and started saying what is that, what is that.  The thing hovered there but very slowly turned for 20 sec. or so.  Than it spun so fast that it turned into a ball and was gone in a streak almost straight up but a little angle towards the n.w.  True true true story.  Also, I might add that the red light was fading on an off like the tower light was.  I believe it was trying to communicate with it and that it was surprised when it finally noticed me or us. I also think that it was some type of probe or something.  The work you are all doing is good work.  We saw what we saw so because of that I know we are not alone.  Sure makes you wonder why that thing was flying around that radio tower?  I don't think that making those forts in the wheat had or has anything to do with it but then again you never know like anything there are more questions than answers.  This was a real deal and I know with all the liars and hoaxes you have to be careful. But this one is true and! I hope it will or it may not help you.  Sincerely; WM  PS It was the size of a small box truck.

I went out onto the front porch, facing East, and saw at least 4 rapidly moving lights in the sky.  Our children joined us outside as well. The lights were moving from West to East, and were orange.  The lights were larger than the stars but smaller than the moon, and they moved very fast, crossing from the West horizon to the East horizon before turning around again in less than ten seconds.   We live in a mountainous area, in a valley which makes our view somewhat restricted, but in the sky that we see the lights were crossing  from one end to the other much faster than planes fly overhead, and there were no clouds blocking our view. It was incredibly cold and clear. When we first saw the lights, there were four and they were flying separate from each other.  Two of the lights moved towards each other and at first seemed to merge and become one slightly larger light before separating again and then appearing to zigzag around each other like they were tracing a double helix.  When the lights were separate, they appeared to blink, but when they came together they stayed solid.  At one point, a third light joined the first two lights, and then all three formed a triangular formation and flew in that pattern for about 20 seconds.  Again, while flying together, they stayed solid and did not blink.  The lights then broke away from each other and made hairpin turns very quickly and moved back towards the West.   As they moved West, they were again blinking and flying in zigzags around each other.  There was a fourth light at this time, that appeared to follow the first three.  This light looked like it was actually 4 smaller lights closely together in! a cube formation, and these appeared to be green.  The small green cube followed more slowly behind the first three, and they all moved towards the Western horizon.  The whole time these lights were moving, there was a loud roaring coming from the sky that was loud enough to shake the windows in the house, and the closer the lights got to the horizon the softer the roaring was until the lights and the noise stopped. We all went back inside, and about 10 minutes later, we heard the roaring start again, so we ran back out onto the porch looking back towards the west, which is towards the back of our house looking towards the treeline.  The roaring continued for about a minute, then abruptly stopped for about 30 seconds, started again for about a minute then abruptly stopped again, repeating this pattern several times.   While we heard the roaring, we could see lights moving over the horizon towards the West, but they were blocked by the trees so we couldn't see if they were in a formation or be sure of how many there were.  This episode lasted for about 3 minutes before the roaring stopped abruptly one final time and did not begin again.",

   "text":"Domed shaped saucer took 1hr and 30 mins to move across the sky. I walked out on my back porch to smoke a cigarette and noticed a bright light threw the only tree in my yard toward the east.  I didnt think too much of it just figured it was the moon or a plane.  I finished smoking and turned to walk back in but it caught my eye again only this time it was a little higher threw the tree.  I really didnt want to be too curious knowin i had to get up at 600 to go to work but I had to see what it was because i knew a plane should have already been past it was just moving too slow.  I walked to the end of my porch and could see it threw the very end of the branches it appeared to be movin but i just told my self it was probably a breeze moving the leafs.  I focused on several different leafs and none of them were moving.  I went out to my shed and proped myself agianst it and lined the object up with the corner of the building and saw then it was moving without a dout.So i went in grabbed my long range rifle with a very high quality scope and bipod because it looked like a very bright star it was just too big.to be a star.  When i set the rifle up and zoomed in as far as i could.  When i looked at it threw the scope i could see it wasnt a star a all. I could see a clear shape of the object and what really stood out was 3 short black lines about 1/4 the way up on the craft from the bottom.  It was saucer shaped up to these lines and domed shape above them.  The color would be light i guess i have never seen anything like it in my life the whole object was bright white like it was being illuminated from the inside.  That's the only way i know how to describe it.  I cant explain how the three black lines were stood out so much on something that bright.  I guess the eye relief on the scope really helped.  I could see the  object was moving almost like a car would if u popped the clutch.  Then it would stabilize and not move any then do the same thing looked very deliberate but not like u would think anything functioning correctly would. It would move west every time.  And through the scope it sometimes would fall out of the recital like a stalled plane would do. I went and woke my wife she watched it awhile then became concerned and wouldn't come back out. It was very very high. I watched it for about a hour moving sporadically but still maintaining its westerly course. Then it stopped and im not sure if it turned or what but it looked like a cube just kind of all of a sudden. It stayed like this for probably ten min and never move inch. I was beginning to wonder what was going on i thought i was loosing it but a very light purple cloud formed under the cube i guess it had to be exhaust. I guess it rotated or something but i could see the original shape once more only the upper part of the craft was very light purple color. It kept movin westward very verly slow then just vanished. there wasnt a cloud in the sky and i never saw it agian. I dont understand what all i saw but the movements were too deliberate to be natural. The light it was putting off was ve! ry very bright i cant understand how the whole object was that bright. To the naked eye it looked like a huge very bright star but that scope told me a different story and i wish i could comprehend what i saw. Thats the best i know how to explain it never seen anything similar in my life. It is what it is.  What that is. Heck if I know.",

   "text":"Saw a greyish black stretched cube with rounded corners with bright white windows on it UFO Sighting by my Cousin My cousin is a nine year old male.  He lives in the northeast US.  He claimed to have seen a UFO on two occasions near his home. Incident #1 Date:  Actual date isn‚Äôt exact though he remembers somewhere in mid January 2009. Time of day: approximately 7PM Location: My cousin was out in the yard playing with his 2 dogs, a golden retriever and a chocolate lab.  He claims that the dogs actually spotted (or heard? or sensed?) the UFO before he did which drew his attention to it.   He spotted a UFO hovering just below the tree line that was shaped like a ‚Äústretched cube‚Äù (rectangular block shaped) ‚Äì the trees were approx 80-90 ft tall (estimated).  My cousin estimated that the UFO was about 1000 ft away from himself.   The grayish-black (charcoal) colored UFO looked like a ‚Äúsquare house with rounded corners with lighted square windows all around it on every side except for the top and bottom which had smaller round white lights‚Äù.  The UFO then came above the tree line and started doing different flipping and turning movements.  He said it didn‚Äôt look like or act like a plane or a helicopter or anything that we know of or make in the US.  He described the pattern of bright white lights along the windows as going all solid and then flashing very quickly in an ordered sequence one after the other and then back to solid.  The lights on the top also flashed in the same pattern.  He claimed that after the craft went above the tree line that it was ‚Äúwatching him‚Äù and sort of ‚Äúshowing off‚Äù as it did its maneuvers.   He estimated the size of the craft as approximately 30-40 feet long and about 10 ft high.  He mentioned that it spun slowly 3 to 4 times on different axes (Y then X and then like a 45 (or 135) degree angled axis).  He noted that after spinning on one axis that it would very quickly move linearly to another position and then spin slowly on a different axis.  Both dogs were trying to get inside the house when the craft appeared.  They were barking and yipping to get inside the house and didn‚Äôt appear comfortable around the UFO.  This whole event lasted for about 3-4 minutes.  He didn‚Äôt hear any sound at all though because his dogs were barking loudly so that pretty much dominated any audio.  However he noted that he didn‚Äôt hear any loud jet-lane type noises.! He men tioned that while the UFO was in the tree line of pine trees that the branches were shaking and shuttering.  He only watched for 4 minutes and then went inside because it was unnerving.  And after inside the house he looked again quickly and it was gone.  He told his parents who didn‚Äôt believe him which is why I am penning this for him (Uncle Age 43) Incident #2 Then about 1.5 months later he claimed to have seen it again in the same spot though only for about 30 seconds this time.  The UFO appeared to execute the same maneuvers as described above in the first incident. He drew some pictures that depict the UFO and how it turned axially and also the lights on the side. My cousin gets good grades in school and isn‚Äôt lying about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"Orange glowing cube near Beaver Dam, WI My son and I were returning home from the Wisconsin Dells Saturday night when my son became increasingly animated about seeing a U.F.O.  I pulled off of Hwy. 33 at the next intersection, got out of my car and spotted a faceted cubic shaped object with a very bright amber light underneath illuminating the craft which appeared to glow orange.  It was almost directly overhead at this point, traveling West to East, and climbing at about the same rate a private plane would.  At this time a State Patrol squad pulled up along side of me and the officer lowered his window and asked \"what's wrong?\"   I said \"My son spotted a U.F.O.-  Take a look\"  He craned his head out of the window and said \"Sure enough, the Air Force must be doing some testing tonight\"   As the object ascended in the distance I got back in the car and traveled at normal Hwy. speed in it's direction but was not able to regain sight again. I've reported this incident to Milwaukee T.V. stations, and they all claim no other reports were filed.",

As my son and I were traveling west on Watson Boulevard, away from the Oakdale Mall, I noticed an object with red and white lights, a cube or sort of square shape, hovering near a \"power line tower\". The lights were static and were not blinking. I slowed down my car to about 15 mph to try to understand what it was.   It appeared to be about 500 feet or more above ground.  It was large, but not huge. My son was in the front passenger seat, and rolled down his window to get a better view. I kept looking and driving slowly and then looked away so I could stay on the road. My son kept watching it.  He said he thought it was the size of about 3 cars. My son also said that it began to move in a north, north east direction. There was no sound whatsoever. I finally turned the car around and pursued the direction we saw it traveling in. We drove up Oakdale Road for about a mile and a half; until we lost sight of the object.  Anonymous",

While we were stopped in heavy traffic, the 2nd \"copter\" swayed erratically from side to side above the busy highway.  It stopped suddenly in mid-air, then turned sharply toward the east, all the while rapidly changing altitude.  It continued to sway from side to side and to bounce up and down. We could see it was not a helicopter, but was an extremely large cube or boxy silver object.  It morphed into an elongated box, then became a sphere and then a whole array of boxy shapes, as it hovered, and raised and lowered its altitude.  We saw no lights on it.  There were no vapors coming from it.  When it changed shape it would momentarily shine like a piece of reflective aluminum. Finally it just shot off to the northeast at a high rate of speed.  I was driving and had to focus on traffic, but my husband in the passenger seat watched the object until it disappeared completely.  The entire episode lasted approximately 5-10 minutes. It was high noon, the sky was a light grey, there was no rain, and no wind. Visibility was about five miles.",

I looked up and there was an object moving extremely fast. I live by Hill AFB and this object moved 5x faster than any F16 F18 F22 I have ever seen. This object wasn't very distinct. Once focused on the object I noticed it was slightly glowing but I only really saw it because the moon was so bright. It was traveling north to south and only through the moonlight did i notice it also had a tail. To be honest it moved just like a meteor but it was so close i could actually see the object. It was bulky in shape almost cubed and left a trail but not a light trail like a meteor it was almost like a smoke trail like a plane would leave but it disappeared very quickly. It looked more like it was just moving so fast it was displacing the atmosphere around it. I would have said it was a meteor but I saw that low flying meteor that passed through the atmosphere back in late '09 and it lit up the entire! sky so I don't believe that this was the same case. This was a big chunk of something that darted across the sky almost invisible. I don't know if this site checks air traffic in the area of these occurrences but I would just like to know what it was thanks.",

On Saturday February 1, 2014, at 3:43 pm north Fresno, CA, I saw what at first I thought was a large black bird coming from the west toward me and my wife, but as I looked it did not have flapping wings.  It did change shape somewhat, not much.   I went into my garage and retrieved my 50X binoculars to get a better look.  What I saw was a black object that seemed to be a jumble of mix of cubes and other shapes mostly black but not completely.  It looked as if it was mottled with black and no color.  The object was tumbling with the sun reflecting and this was why it appeared to be changing shape.  I came to the conclusion that it must be a bunch of balloons as the tumbling seemed to be effortless.   As I was breathing heavy from yard work it was hard to get a very stable look with the binocular.  I looked around to find something stable my shaking.  Not finding anything I looked up without the binoculars and could not find it.  I asked my wife where it was as she was watching it only with her eyes.  She said it just disappeared, was there and then gone.   The object was traveling west to east at about 25 mph and was about 500 feet above us.  The weather was clear and no wind at all.  The object appeared to have a flat path not going up or down.  It‚Äôs hard to say what size it was but I would guess it was 20 feet across.  It was not a uniform shape.  Also no sound.",

This object was really high in the sky, above the approach that airliners take to DFW or Love field. At first I thought it must be the blimp ready for the Dallas game that day. Upon further inspection while we sat at a red light in my truck it defiantly was a big Black Box shaped thing? I couldn‚Äôt make out much detail but it seemed to have what I would call notches like a cube on it. At this time the light turned green and we drove due north, at this time my daughter saw a jetliner on approach to DFW and it was way below the alt of this thing. When we stopped again at the intersection of Robison rd and Westchester it was still there and the plane had traveled quite away and was disappearing from sight. AS we sat at the red light watching this thing it just disappeared?",

I think all this started to happen in the last few years when I saw a round object in the day sky go over my backyard. It had a military plane a few hundred feet above it. My husband was in the living room with me when I watched the handle on my sun porch move and the door opened.  He heard the handle and went over to check it.  No explanation for that either.  I am getting scared as I am alone a lot.

The lights on this craft are non-typical. There is a blinking blue-white light at the front. Then there a bar with several lights that are slightly orange (maybe about the color of tungsten lights), just past the center of the craft, that go laterally, and look like cubes placed side by side. They shine towards the front and back of the craft. There are no lights on this craft that are typical of normal aircraft navigational lights. It appears that the craft is black with a tan colored ‚ÄúX‚Äù painted on the bottom side. The ends of the X shape are at the front and back of the craft. This craft makes no sound that I can detect.  All five times I have seen the craft it has been moving from North to South, and at different altitudes. My sighting of it have all been at night, shortly after the sun has set and it is complete dark outside.  The first time I saw this craft was in late May or early June, and I have seen it four times, about once a month, since then. The first time I saw it, I happened to look up, and it had passed right over the top of where I was standing. It was moving fairly slowly, and made no sound that I could hear. I have not been able to see the actual outline shape of the craft against the night sky, but it appears to be either flat on the bottom, or possibly slightly concave. It is many times wider than a normal airplane or jet.  In hindsight I should have recorded the times and dates of the previous sightings of this craft, or made reports on them.  Another report of a craft that might be similar can be seen here:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58560.html",

I was driving north on La Cienega at around Wilshire.  Two helicopters patrolled the area, and 1 plane descended slightly in it's flight path, possibly to avoid the object.  After remaining stationary for just about 30 seconds, it began to move again, towards downtown (to my right at the time).  While driving, I lost sight of the object behind trees and buildings.  Approximately 20 minutes later, at about 4:45PM, I was heading into downtown LA towards the central library.  I was just exiting the 10 West onto the 110 North.  As I came around the curve, I saw the object again, exactly as before, in the skies above the city to the north, northeast of route 110 (a little ahead and to the left of the highway from my perspective.  I looked around at other vehicles and nobody seemed to notice it.  Behind me in a white/cream colored volkswagen station wagon, were a couple in their late 60's, early 70's.  They saw the object also, but exited at 9th St.  I continued on the 110 to the 4th street exit, and as I did so the object came much nearer to the roadway.  It was very large, massive is the word that I kept thinking.  The closer it got to me, it looked less and less round, and I could identify individual colors, including red and black.  The object was a structure, for certain, and was vaguely cube shaped.  There appeared to be some sort of boom, or large metal pole hanging down below the craft.  It did not look aerodynamic at all.  It kept a solid form, and did not waver, heading in a straight line.  It was was too big and way too stable to have been balloons blowing in the wind.  It floated overhead, and I lost sight of it as I took the 4th street exit.  I was back on the 110 heading south again 20 minutes later, and did not see the craft in the sky.",

This helicopter had the apparent length of a CH-47 military helicopter, but was unidentifiable due to lack of lighting.  It had none of the regular blinking red lights, but had alternatingly green, orange, and blue bright lights flashing in a regular pattern.  It appeared to have some sort of attached storage device under it, cube or rectangular shaped. The light configuration and storage construct was unlike anything I had seen before.  The altitude of the helicopter was about 75 meters.  The helicopter was there from about the time I recieved the call (possibly earlier) and bugged out at approx. 0010 hours in a N/NW direction. We approached the location my family member gave me and parked alongside 9 other vehicles, each with 2-5 people in them all looking in the same direction.  We personally were unable to see the UFO as it left minutes before we arrived.  We stayed for about 45 minutes and it did not reappear. The family member that called me took video on her cellphone and upon getting home, we loooked online and there was already one other video of the event posted. On a perhaps unrelated note, a cell phone in the house at 2232 hours experienced service interruption and emitted an electronic tone I have never heard before.  The tone sounded like the hybrid tone of a dial up phone, but without the tempo or form associated with that normal tone. The cell phone video my family member took is available if needed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

   "text":"Brilliant white \"square\" stationary in the sky above west Orange County / Lake County Florida. On 15 August 2008, from approximately 6:25pm to 6:30pm, I observed an unusual object in the sky while I was driving home from work.  I had just merged onto SR429 from the Florida Turnpike, heading north toward Apopka, Florida.  The weather was partly cloudy, but it was not raining, and visibility was good.  Looking out my driver‚Äôs side window (toward the west), something in the sky caught my attention. An incredibly bright, white object appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky at what I would estimate to be 700ft to 800ft in altitude.  My initial reaction was that the object was probably an airplane reflecting sunlight while banking, but after continuing to observe it, I quickly realized that was not the case. The object appeared to be perfectly square in shape, not a cube, but a flat, square shape.  It was smooth, with very clearly defined perimeter lines and corners, and was a very brilliant color of white;  incredibly bright, but in a different manner than the brightness of the sun (very comfortable to look at, no glare associated with it, and its brightness did not obscure its shape at all; there was no  \"halo\" or other glow surrounding it in spite of its brightness).  It seemed to be illuminated from inside of the object, even though the object was so flat that it appeared to be almost two dimensional.  The object was located well below the cloud cover, and stuck out like a sore thumb against the overcast, grey sky. I would estimate my distance from the object to be at least one mile.  I‚Äôm not sure I can accurately estimate the size of the object, but my impression was that it was fairly large given that I could clearly see the outline of its shape at that distance.  The best description I can give regarding its size is that if you held your thumb up at arm‚Äôs length, the object would appear to be slightly smaller than your thumbnail. The object was absolutely stationary in the sky; no movement whatsoever for the entire period that I observed it (at least 5 minutes).  While observing the object, I noticed a small, round flashing light that appeared to be further west of the object, but moving toward it.  When the flashing light had almost reached the bright, square object, they both disappeared.  I spent several minutes trying to spot them again, but they never reappeared.",

I thought it might b a nuke.  Then I saw two fighter jets fly toward it then it dissapeared.  The smoke trail it left was incredible. Figure eights, zig-zags, then at the top a perfect 3d cube.  None of our phones would work to take a pic.  Well bout five to nine fighter jets began flying straight up then down and all over all morning.  I was in seven 11 parkin lot n pointed them out to bystanders, who at the time were oblivious.  they were shocked at the site of the fighter jets.  I was so excited by the incident, that i called my dad to tell him of the events, n to c if he could see the jets.  I called my exgirlfriend who lives in philadelphia, n she said there were a bout 8 fighter jets in the sky up there, this was around 9a.m.  My dad called back and said there had been a newsflash of the reports.  The media said that the government shot off two missles off of an island off of virginia.  They made no mention of why, and made no other mention of it.  They blamed the smoke trail on the weather.  The smoke trail itself was incredible because it sat in the air for a good ten minutes.   i have met six other people than my friends that witnessed the same event.  The fighter jets were in the sky until dark.  My exgirlfriend told me that she saw on the news that they were saying they released a new fighter jet that day, explaining why they were in the sky.  Y did the government shoot off rockets for no reason, then have fighter jets go after it.  The hole the others from the ohare airport describe sounds similar to ! the ligh t n how it dissapeared.  It was the most amazing thing my eyes have seen.  They cant deny the truth forever. 1 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides only telephone number.  The missile launch occurred at approximately 07:00 hrs.

It was Seen Several more Times over the Summer and on a Very Cloudy Night it was Seen by many People in Town Shining a Beam down into the Water. On July 2nd  2011 18:00 hours, Overcast, I Witnessed from Indian Point an Orange ball UFO over Pagan Point, Travelling slowly South to North along the Beach followed by a Flash of light, then I Felt this Very Powerful Wave of Emery go by Me and an Object Dropped from the Sky, By then the UFO Disappeared. The Next Day July 3rd 2011 08:00 hours, Overcast, I went Out to the Area to Find what ever had Fallen from the Sky near the UFO. The First thing i Found was a Meteorite looking, Soft Ball sized  Rock (1468g) with makings like a Space Capsule Heat Shield with Fresh Reentry Burns and Looks just Like an ALIEN EYE looking at You and A Map of our Solar System. Next to the First Rock was a Second Meteorite looking Rock the Size of a Golf Ball (166g) with a Very Dark Green Colour and a Texture like Reptile Skin. The Third Rock Inches away is a Bust (1466g) of a Reptilian King on one Side and the Queen on the other side Both with a Crown and a Horn on Top of the Head plus Teeth. (Very Creepy)  The Fourth Rock was Found Earlier in the Year. A local News Paper did a Story on the find a Basket Ball sized Rock/Meteorite 20kg (Now broken-up) With vanes of Gold, Silver and Copper. The Gold and Copper is in the Shape of Perfect 'Borg' Cubes, the Silver flows like Water. I Think this is an Area that Attracts Dimensional UFOs & Hitchhikers like Meteorites and Space Junk. I Would love to See that is Inside the Rocks, But after Seeing the History Channels Ancient Aliens on Plagues that May half Come from Meteorites this is Very Scary.",

   "text":"The Lights Over the Great Salt Lake and West Desert On Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at approximately 9:30pm on my return home from the gym I parked my car in my driveway facing towards the western sky.  I was talking to a friend on my phone when I noticed in the dark bluish skies a stationary changing light.  It was quite familiar to me, because over the past couple of years family members and I have seen these lights.  But, the difference this time was that these lights were much closer than previous sightings. I quickly ended my phone conversation and ran inside to tell my Father and grab my new camera (Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS) that I had purchased about a week previous.  Both of us went to the back porch overlooking the Great Salt Lake and Antelope Island.  I attempted to take a still picture of the object, but was unable to capture anything visible.  Not having used my video feature yet, I tried recording a video which I did with much better success. I recorded six segments of video on my camera from lengths of about 1:30 to 8:00 minutes long.  We both made observations on the closeness of the object (approximately 75 miles from our location).  Because of the closeness of the object we could see a better view of the rotating lights and movement  of the craft from previous sightings. We could see the distinct rotation of the craft that made it look like a tumbling Rubix's cube.  It seemed to stay stationary in the night sky.  If there was movement it was slight and westward.  The lights on the object changed frequently between reds, blues, oranges and greens.  It looked as though it was moving in a Disco light fashion, very fast and very rapid.  Occasionally the middle of the object would pulsate into a black circle and then retract. We observed this object for approximately 25 minutes until the light got more and more faint into the night sky.  We couldn't determine if the object was moving westward over the Great Salt Lake or Dugway Testing Center.  But, there were no sudden movements or set orbit during those 25 minutes.  We couldn't imagine this was an aircraft even though the Salt Lake International Airport and Hill Air Force base are nearby.  We ruled out a planet, because of the tumbling rotation and brilliant lights.  It could easily be a drone observing something, possibly towards the Dugway Testing Center?    Whatever it was we have been seeing this object over the west skies of the Great Salt Lake and Dugway Testing Center the past couple of years.  Nothing as close as we saw on the night of May 4, 2011.   I would love any logical explanation.",

   "text":"Mysterious black rectangular object in the North Charleston sky. Hi, I'm an area manager for a small chain of stores in Mt. Pleasant and Charleston County, SC.  Well yesterday, 11-1-09, I was driving home to North Charleston from one of our stores loacted in Mt. Pleasant.  I always take the 526 home to North Charleston.  It was just before sunset yesterday and as I was driving I saw the strangest thing in the sky.  It looked like a black rectangular object that wasn't moving, way up in the sky against the clouds.  I thought \"what the heck is that?\" and had to keep driving but I did slow down some.  There is no safe place to pull off the road once on the 526.  Well I kept watching it and watching it as I drove.  I believe I saw another craft of some sort up way, way above it and to the right of it and this smaller, harder to see craft may have been plane shaped.  I began to think things.  I thought that maybe there was a helicopter or plane towing something. But I really didn't see a tow chain or rope of any kind between the two, but that's what it looked like.  Now my immagination went wild and I want to say it reminded me of the Star Trek Enterprise pulling the borg cube with a tractor beam! Seriously, I thought well there must be a logical explanation.  I thought the airforce might have been doing some scientific experiment and may have dropped or pulled something from behind a plane or helicopter as a weather/wind experiment or something like that.  I thought well maybe one of those planes that pull an advertisement sign behind it like those I see off the beach when I go to Daytona. I just don't know anything.  Now I want to believe that it was a spaceship from outerspace with extraterrestrials on it.  I really, really do!  All I really know for sure however is that I saw something in the sky that didn't seem to be moving at first, like a black, rectangular window against the white clouds way high up that day.  Then I saw the other thing, the maybe plane shaped craft.  Now the black object either turned and narrowed, or as I drove foreward I saw from a different angle and it narrowed.  I believe they started to slowly move and eventually I lost sight of them because I entered into my own neighborhood and trees blocked any further view of them.   As soon as I got home yesterday I wrote to MUFON and a representative from MUFON called me last night.  Today I told my boss about the incident and I even tried to contact the Charleston Airforce base to ask if they had anything unusual or unexplained on their radar over North Charleston yesterday, but I cou! ldn't find an e-mail addy that would do any good.  I watched and looked at the thing for a good fifteen minutes on my way home on this 526.  There were plenty of other cars on the road and I'm surprised nobody else noticed, if they did, they didn't post a report about it.  Well I'm a definate believer.  I'm convinced!  I am not a skeptic.  I believe in UFOs and in extraterrestrial life.  I've seen too much not to be a believer.  I sure intend to keep on watching the sky!",

   "text":"Rare White Light of Unknown Origin with Pulse/Strobe/Ovalblanket On Sunday, December 30, 2012, at 06:39am EST, in Dulles, Virginia (within 2 miles of Dulles International Airport, ‚ÄòDulles Discovery‚Äô building, and Air and Space Museum) a ‚Äòmassive‚Äô light strobe/flash was spotted.  Upon a windy, cloudy (but not covered) sky, straight above the witness‚Äô head (very steep angle), happened the event, lasting no more than 0.5 seconds, but no less than 0.12 seconds. The anomaly was unlikely a form of lightning, due to the duration, size, and shape. The ‚Äòlight‚Äô, which again was a massive strobe, could be described as; oval or circle or rectangle (or even square) (to match a best description of its top-down (or ground-to-air view, bird‚Äôs eye from the ground, etc.)).  The SIZE description as; massive, football field (much larger ‚Äì 3 to 4 times this size or even larger).  The size of the entire light portion of the ‚Äòcraft‚Äô (the defined shape, most notably ‚Äòrectangle‚Äô/futbol field with a ‚Äòcentral sun‚Äô or ‚Äòfocus point‚Äô (seemingly the witness‚Äô location, but at a height of only about 60-100 feet above) low in the clouds (clouds fast moving, ‚Äòfocus point‚Äô occulted by the cloud cover, although cloud cover not total ‚Äì moon waning, shining in the west). Also notable about the consciousness of the witness ‚Äì the awareness at the time of ‚ÄúIndians‚Äù.  Not ‚ÄúIndia‚Äù such as Kashmir, but of the Native American Indian.  The ‚Äòawareness‚Äô, ‚ÄòESP‚Äô, ‚Äòtele‚Äô, etc. was certainly ‚Äòdulled‚Äô at the time of the event, but included subconscious notable features; Indians, Redskins, Native American Indian, American Dream, American Spirit, American Spirit (cigarette) (natural tobacco), Football Field, Redskins vs. Cowboys, Star (5 points), Cube Form (RGIII, (playoff)), Washington Post, holiday time, new year (time for exposure for anomalies).  The subconscious ‚Äòtiming‚Äô of these events is believed by the witness to be ‚Äòdata‚Äô supporting the timing of the sighting, and the importance in the witness‚Äô own life (spiritual). It could also be reported and fit a description that a ‚Äúflying wing‚Äù (but massive in size and silent in sound) was moving at a very fast speed, engaged a light on/off (or simply sped up [down] and then up, and the light was never ‚Äòoff‚Äô).  Contrary to the physics of the last descriptive sentence (flying down, then up, with light on), the witness‚Äô account does not recall ‚Äòvertical‚Äô movement, but ‚Äòhorizontal‚Äô movement from North (but ‚Äòstarting‚Äô just South of the Airport), travelling Southeast (or travelling in a vertical direction, but ‚Äòthe light‚Äô expanding towards the Southeast (probably only an apparency of the witness‚Äô viewpoint) (also, the ‚Äòlight‚Äô was centralized like a candle flame is, only the light expanded ‚Äì so it is unique that movement was also sensed).  It can also be said that ‚Äòlack of movement‚Äô had caused a dizzying ‚Äòneed‚Äô or ‚Äòdeception‚Äô of movement, in which the witness may or may not have seen, but the ‚Äòelapsed time‚Äô of the light/strobe anomaly seemed more ‚Äòstill! ‚Äô. Nevertheless of the movement, the flash/ball/oval/field/rectangle blanketing WAS seen and realized, with almost definite ‚Äòsource‚Äô to the light, pinpointed near/above witness‚Äô location. Finally, it can be noted that the witness believes it is possible for the ‚Äúcraft‚Äù to belong to mankind, but if so, secret/not public knowledge.  It is doubtful, from the witness‚Äô consideration, that the ‚Äúcraft‚Äù (if in reality, a craft composed of matter, as explained above) is of primitive technologies (such as publicly known U.S. Military technologies).

   "text":"Bright orange/yellow sphere moving like no man-made craft My wife and I were about to go into the house at about 22:30h. A few steps ahead of me she called back me, \"Honey, what's that?\", fully expecting me to provide a comfortable and critical natural explanation for the large and very bright light in the sky.  Now standing at the front of the house and facing North I see a very bright sphere of light that I first assume is either a very near and low-flying aircraft or a very large fireball coming straight at us. I am an amateur astronomer and cosmology buff for over thirty years.  I am critical nearly to the point of cynical, yet I find myself refusing to admit that what we saw was anything other than unfamiliar or not earthly technology. Looking North from the Niagara River the object appeared about 5 degrees above Polaris and appeared to be getting closer as its size and brilliance increased.  A very bright orange/yellow it was similar in size and somewhat in color to the street light on the road in front of our house before it stopped approaching (or increasing in size).  It outshone the streetlight only seven meters away.  Until that moment I was getting a little fearful that this may be a city killer asteroid coming straight at us.  There was no sound and no trail behind it.  It was headed straight at us or it wasn't a massive bolide at all.  It appeared to slow or stop so the bolide question was answered. I opened the door to the house and yelled for the children (ages 8 and 30) to rush outside.  The object, now at its nearest, would no longer appear to be coming Southward toward us, but slip Westward at great speed, then stop, then slip on over some more, then stop.  It did this about eight times before remaining stationary.  The whole time it scintillated as the stars do above a moist sky.  The four of us stood there with our eyes trained on it while it begin to shrink and dim in spurts as though it may have been moving away from us the way it had been moving to the West with the jerky movements.  With each successive \"pulse\" it grew smaller and fainter.  It didn't seem like it was moving away.  It appeared more like it was just shrinking and fading. I have no idea of how large or distant the object was.  I'm no expert at scale. I can only relate the scale by saying the object at its most brightest and biggest was easily as large as my thumbnail with my arm outstretched in front of me.  I spent some of the night and this morning looking for news of sightings over anywhere from Niagara Falls to Ottawa.  I just can't seem to guess how far it was away. The light surrounded the object.  High humidity would have easily revealed beams of light from lamps as it did for every other passing aircraft that night and most nights. There were no beams, just a large, very bright scintillating light moving awkwardly through the sky. As I told my wife before sleep, I was so excited to have witnessed the event.  I didn't know what I invited my children to see.  Did I call my little boy outside to witness the end of his life by an asteroid, or was this an alien craft and what were their intentions?  It was all very exciting and terrifying at the same time.  I have never felt like that before.  Skeptics don't get much excitement. All my life I have wanted to see a \"UFO\".  Two weeks ago my wife and I and one of our sons observed a daytime object and actually had time to retrieve two sets of binoculars for further observation.  I was unable to explain what I saw.  It looked like a large building made of up compartments (cubes) or maybe like a bunch of buildings stuck together. It wasn't round anywhere.  The Sun reflected brightly from only one small part at a time as it moved across the sky.  The rest of it appeared a dark grey or black.  Without binoculars it simply appeared to be a small ball of light as you would expect from sunlight reflected from a metallic object.  It caught our attention in the first place because it was so high in the sky yet didn't appear to be moving (like all the rest of high-flying air traffic was doing).  It did move large distances in quick moments somewhat like the ball of light last night.  We lost track of it after each quick shot across some distance, then found it s! tationery ahead of the direction it seemed to go.  We lost it for good the third time. I told my son, \"You are so fortunate to have witnessed such a thing. That could very well have been people from another world!\".  Wow!  I never expected something like that to come out of this skeptic's mouth.  My childhood dream of seeing a UFO is now fulfilled - twice in one month.  Although my son (age 8) also has his own telescope and a very good knowledge of astronomy and cosmology, I don't think he entirely grasps the measure of what we witnessed together. I really don't know exactly what we saw, but I'm still sort of in a state of shock.  I woke up still excited from last night's events.  My wife and I can't stop remarking at how last night's viewing was the first time I did not have my cell phone with me. I could have recorded video...",

   "text":"Spotted black hovering UFO of unusual/hard to distinguish shape near parking lot, before flying away at high speed. This sighting was very much a spontaneous encounter on my part, and ended almost as quickly as it began.  I was in my car, parked outside a strip mall next to a park, with a Taekwondo studio and Scuba Diving store in front of me.  I had just dropped off a family member, and was reading a book for college while waiting in the vehicle for my family member to return in about an hour.  A friend called me on my cell phone; I became distracted from reading, and so we talked for about five minutes before the beginning of the UFO encounter.   I was casually looking outside at my surroundings without much attentiveness, when I spotted this apparent craft.  I did not actually think it was an aircraft at all, at first.  I was looking up at the dark/grayish clouds in front of me, and I glanced in the craft‚Äôs direction, thinking I had just seen a small dark break the clouds in my peripheral vision - as if I could see through to a darker cloud layer.  I was not at all alarmed, nor did I suspect it was a flying object.  I continued talking, and when I turned my attention to the area again maybe about 10 seconds later, I looked more closely, and noticed this was not a break in the clouds.  Something was definitely there, well below the cloud layer. I knew very quickly it wasn‚Äôt a bird or plane, because it was hovering completely motionless in the air.  My immediate assumption was that this was a helicopter, which is perfectly reasonable, as I see them fly by from time to time, even at this particular parking lot.   I like to check out aircraft whenever I seen them, so I asked my friend to wait a moment while I sat up closer to my dashboard to focus in on the supposed helicopter.  I saw it was smaller than a helicopter; it had no tail, no propeller blades or moving parts, and made no audible sound.  It was unusually difficult to make out its shape.  This may have been because of its size and the dark backdrop.   But I stared at it for maybe about 20 seconds as it hovered there in the sky, absolutely motionless, expecting it to move.  I was so surprised at how still it was, I even moved my head left to right, just to be sure I wasn‚Äôt somehow staring at a speck of dust on my windshield.  I am pretty sure it had corners; it was not an oval or sphere exactly, but it seemed like it was maybe rounded slightly.   I can‚Äôt say for absolute certain, like I said earlier, the shape was hard to make out - but if I had to guess, it was perhaps a cube or triangle with rounded edges.  Very dark ‚Äì basically black in color, and may have had a small gray or white marking on it, but I cannot say for certain as it could have been a reflection of the sky, if it was metallic.  But from my angle at least, I would describe it as fairly dull; a matte black. In terms of size, I would say it was one to two meters across, and one-half to one meter in height.   I was still on the phone, and began describing the object to my friend, who was listening closely, and became a little concerned for me.  I did not feel threatened by it, but was very curious nonetheless.  I sometimes keep a pair of binoculars in my glove compartment, and so I began quickly rummaging through papers, napkins, and tools I keep in there, while still keeping an eye on the object, only occasionally glancing into the glove compartment fo r a second or two.   I had two plausible explanations in my mind; it was either a big balloon of some kind, or a drone, but I wanted to find out for certain.   At the exact moment I thought that, it started to move slightly to the left, and then a second later bolted off at high speed, traveling backwards, away from me. It did not tilt, turn, or otherwise look like it had control surfaces or a propulsion system.  I became upset it was leaving, and I could not find my binoculars.  Still talking to my friend, I figured I took them out of the compartment a few months ago to bring on a boat trip, and forgot to return them.  The craft left the location pretty fast; in about 15 seconds, it was a tiny little dot, and disappeared somewhere behind buildings or trees.   I found it very unlikely to be a balloon because if it was, it probably would have been smaller and round, likely would have had a string or something attached to it, and would have been ascending at a constant rate, not to mention being bobbed and brushed by the wind - not sitting perfectly still in the air, before suddenly bursting off at a very high speed in basically one direction.   It is hard to guess how high and far it was from my location with only a limited number of items for a point of reference, but I would say no more than a quarter mile from where I was parked.  It was relatively low; my best guess, I would say between 6! 00 and 800 feet above the ground.   When it moved, it began gently, and increased speed very quickly.  I would approximate maybe 250 to 300 mph the last I saw it.  Also note, there was a young man, maybe about 25, sitting in his car parked next to me, but he was facing the opposite direction and was staring at his phone, so I did not bother to ask if he had also seen the craft after it had left.   As far as I could tell, we were the only two people in the parking lot capable of viewing the craft.   Once the surprise and adrenaline rush had worn down, I resumed my conversation with my friend, speculating what it could have been. I regretted not taking a picture with my phone, but on the other hand, it probably would have been too small to turn up as anything more than a few pixels on the image anyway.  I decided to take a picture at least of the sky conditions where the craft was, about five minutes after it left, to give some perspective as to how I saw it. The only plausible and conventional explanation I have was that it was a large, black, very fast moving drone, with long range wireless capabilities.  This is a suburban area, so it was hovering and passing over small buildings, houses, and some forested areas.  I have walked near the place where the craft was in the past, and I know there are some small fields and depressions in the ground, as well as a high school it most definitely would have passed over or near.  I do not know how long it was hovering there prior, but I know it sat still for at least the minute or two that I saw it from when I first glanced it in the sky.  For a craft that size and altitude, it should have had some light beacon to indicate its presence to other aircraft, and I would have expected it to be flatter with four or more distinguishable copter propellers if it was a drone.  This craft did not possess any of those features as far as I could tell, but I would be willing to accept a drone as a conventional answer.  I readily acknowledge that it is just an unidentified flying object.  I am not necessarily trying so suggest this was some event so extraordinary that it exceeds all conventional reasoning, nor that it is of extraterrestrial or otherwise supernatural origin.  It was certainly very odd though, and this is not the first instance in the time I have lived here that I have seen unusual or inexplicable aircraft. There was one other event that occurred on my thirteenth birthday when I was walking home from a store.  I was on the top of a hill nearing my neighborhood next to a forested area with only a couple sleepy houses to my right side, when I spotted a silvery metal craft, oval in shape flying over the forest, completely silent, and traveling at similar heights and speeds to this one. Unlike the case I am presenting here, I do have a picture of the actual craft itself (albeit a poor resolution one) taken from my phone, and posted on Facebook. In the original image, the craft was too small to see without zooming in, but it was nevertheless in the image.  I searched old data folders and even tried to revive the (now dead) phone I took the photo with to see if I could retrieve the original file, but unfortunately could not bring it back. In the Facebook photo of this somewhat similar craft, I enlarged the image of the craft and drew a red line indicating where it was in the image so t! hat people could view it more easily, but other than that, there was no editing or tampering concerning the image of the craft itself. Both that one and this one traveled in about the same direction, heading north-northwest. This was before drones (especially of that size) were commercially available as they are today. I have not made any case files on this previous sighting, and this is the first time I have reported a UFO, because I felt compelled enough to say this really was unusual enough to constitute a true UFO. After showing the first encounter to friends online, they did not believe me, thinking I had pocket lint on my camera, even though I assured them something was in the air. I dropped the topic, and rarely spoke of it again, but with this new sighting, it has made me think back on that experience. I am not suggesting there is any direct connection or correlation, but these events are similar in some ways, and this new encounter marks the second time I have seen! an unusual or unconventional aircraft in this area, seven yea! rs apart , in the same stretch of about 5 miles.

   "text":"I completed a report on your site over a year ago and it was very brief and not as descriptive as I should have been in my initial report.  But since the time of my sighting, I have left out so many other significant factors to that night/morning that I just felt compelled to write to you again and explain the whole event, as there is so much more to mention. I have talked about my experience with several people over the past several months and have been made fun of countless times by friends and co-workers, but I still feel the need to explain the whole story to get it off my chest. On 1/2/09, I received a call from a friend‚Äôs son, who begged me to come up to Lafayette CO, to watch some meteor showers after I got off of work.  It was on a Friday and I was very tired and did not want to drive up there and hang out that particular night.  But the boy who was 13 or 14 at the time kept insisting that I come up and stay the night.  In fact, her 2 other children got on the phone and begged to see me as well and after I spoke with them, I felt compelled to drive up there.  So I packed a bag and headed north from my house in Denver. I arrived at about 8:00pm-8: 30pm and it was cold and I was dragging butt after a long week.  The kids immediately asked me to run to 7-11 to buy firewood for the outdoor fireplace as it was going to be even colder later that night and into the early morning hours.  So I bought 3 or 4 bundles of wood for our night.  Upon our return from 7-11, we hung out for a while and planned our night and agreed that we (my friend and I) would get up around 3:00am-3: 30am to start making hot cocoa and coffee for the 4:00 am showers.  But at around 11:00pm-11: 30pm, the kids were very hyper and were not ready for bed by any means.  They asked me if we could burn one of the bundles of wood and sky watch for a while before heading to bed.  I hesitantly said yes but knew that I was fading fast and didn‚Äôt have much energy from a long week at work.  At any rate, I didn‚Äôt want to disappoint them, so we headed outside. Once we got the fire going and brought out blankets and snacks, my friend‚Äôs daughter (7 yr. old) climbed on lap to stay warm.  The 2 boys, I believe were 13 and 11 were running around singing loud and throwing things in the yard.  I was getting annoyed because I didn‚Äôt have the energy they had and I really wanted to just chill out and relax in quite and peace.  The little girl fell asleep in my lap almost immediately as she was bundled up well and was pretty warm.   About 10-15 minutes after she fell asleep, I saw a gray animal or \"something\" running in a very weird manner along the side of the fence.  Whatever it was, it used a hand as well as its legs to run and hop at the same time.  At first glance I thought it was a wild animal and as soon as I had that thought, I literally threw the girl off of me and yelled, \"What ((deleted)) was that?\"   This thing moved very fast along the fence and was gone in no time at all.   My friend had her back to the \"thing\" and the boys were running wild and didn‚Äôt see anything.  I was so freaked out; I didn‚Äôt want to stay out there anymore.  I told them what I saw and they kept asking questions and so on.  Finally, I said that I was going to go inside and sleep for a while because I was getting up at 3:00am-3: 30am to make the snacks and then to watch the showers.  Plus, we needed to save some of the wood I bought.  So the boys said that they were staying downstairs to watch movies with the intention of staying awake all night.  My friend, her daughter and I went upstairs to her bedroom and we all were going to sleep together in the same bed.  After we jumped into bed, I was on one end, my friend in the middle, and her daughter was at the other end snuggled up with her mom.  I fell asleep immediately. After sleeping for a while, I woke up freezing like I have never felt before. (I have lived in Colorado my whole life and never wore coats in the winter and would only wear jackets because I am always hot).  So I pulled the blankets up to cover myself up more.  As soon as I did this, I was immediately burning up.  I threw the blankets off of me, and I was freezing again.   By this time, I woke up because my face touched my arm, which was like an ice-cube.  My eyes opened and I rolled over to see a purple light hovering below the ceiling.  I tried to focus my eyes to understand what I was seeing, but I could never really make out what it was.  It just changed shapes and was hovering about 3 or 4 inches from the ceiling, closer to my side of the bed.  I watched the thing for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to get dressed and start making the coffee and snacks. 1/3/09  At about 3:40am, I woke up my friend and told her what happened in the bedroom and she decided to get up too.  I also told her that the boys were downstairs sleeping in the livingroom with the TV still on.  I told her to look for her video camera with the infrared feature so that we can have it for the showers.   Then it occurred to me that she may want a smoke before the kids got up (they didn‚Äôt know she smoked) so we decided to smoke first before getting any cameras together.  Besides, I‚Äôm not good with any kind of camera with the exception of a cell phone camera so this was going to be all on her to set that part up. This is the part that I originally reported to this site, but I left out some stuff so I need to re-tell the story. A couple of minutes before 4:00am, we went outside to smoke.  We were out there for a short while when I saw what looked like a flock of geese flying towards us.  I pointed in the direction of where I was looking and yelled, \"Look!\"   As soon as I said that, I then realized that this was not a flock of geese at all.  It was a triangular shaped object that was gray on the outside of the perimeter and on the bottom, but shiny black finish on the rest of it.   As soon as I told her to look, the thing changed direction a little and aimed its path towards us.  It was directly over us about 300-500 ft in the air and made no sound and was moving very slow.  I initially said that it was going 30-40mph, but it was going slower than that.  My friend stood there with her mouth open and totally freaked out and I started checking in with her because I thought she was going to start screaming or something.   By this time, we could see directly underneath this thing and again, it was gray, with a light at each point of the triangle, with a round \"portal\" in the center and some weird designs on the bottom.  It didn‚Äôt make a sound at all. It started moving in between her house and her neighbor‚Äôs house and I started to chase it.  When I started running after it, I knocked over the chairs on the patio and bumped the table really loud, when all of the sudden, it disappeared right in front of us.  The lights weren‚Äôt on, but something inside was illuminating the lights from within to let us know they were lights.  And it looked as though it was using our street lamps and porch lights to guide itself.  I know I said that we watched this thing for 7 seconds in the first report, but there was no way it could have been that short because of the detail we were able to extract from it.  That was one of the things that always bothered me about it my first report. It was more like 20-30 seconds. After it disappeared, we went in and woke up the boys first.  My friend said, \"That was the most amazing UFO I have ever seen.\"  We started telling the kids to get up in case it came back, and because it was time for the showers.  So after we got settled in our spots, the showers came down immediately.  During the showers, we saw more UFO activity with lights flying low all over the place and doing crazy maneuvers and indescribable movements. We would keep talking about it for the next 2 hours. So at about 6:00am-6: 30am, the wood was almost gone, the winds were picking up and some light snow started to fall. I told everyone that I was going back to bed because I really didn‚Äôt sleep much and I was freezing again.  So I went upstairs to lay down in my friend‚Äôs bed again alone.  The purple light was gone this time.  At about 7:00am, my friend came in to crash too for a while.  However, at 8:30am, I got up to go to the bathroom. In the bathroom, there are lots of windows to look at onto the front yard.  When I glanced out of one of the windows, I saw a light layer of snow (about an inch high) covering the ground, with a perfect circle partly on the grass, sidewalk, and street in her front yard.  There were no tire tracks, footprints of any kind or anything else near the circle or any other place out front. It was totally untouched by humans or animals. I woke my friend up again and to show her what was out front.  She looked out the window and asked me, \"What the hell happened last night?\" I know this was a long story, but I had to go back and correct some things.  I just couldn‚Äôt keep all of this information out of this crazy experience.  I swear that I am not making this up and have witnesses to substantiate this weird night/morning.  My friend has agreed to talk to anyone about her piece of the story too.  However, we do have to keep the kids out of it for obvious reasons.  However, my friend‚Äôs children and I have experienced other UFO‚Äôs that same year, at that same house.  And there is more to tell, believe me!  But that was the most amazing UFO at that house because it was so huge.  But we do have more stories about some other cool sighting too of a smaller triangle flying 20ft above our heads 3x‚Äôs in the same night.  But that‚Äôs another story for another time.  Besides, I don‚Äôt remember the date of that one.",

   "text":"A seemingly cloaked or disguised craft 4/23/07 Elmore, Alabama   Dear Sir, I am a Correctional Officer with the Alabama Department of Corrections and work at one of the prisons in Elmore County, Alabama.   This morning several other officers and myself observed an odd phenomenon.  What we saw appeared to us to be some sort of cloud which upon closer examination appeared to be some sort of flying craft hidden or, to use a term from Star Trek, \"cloaked,\" so as to be unseen. Before we are laughed off as nuts, let me explain the whole story as it happened:   It was around 8:00 AM and was the morning count time and I was a dorm officer.  My dorm partner and myself counted \"A\" side of the dorm. Then as she went through the \"cube\" in the middle of the dorm to go through to the other side I went outside to go along the sidewalk to the other side to count. As I was walking along I felt a sudden blast of wind or breeze and felt sand stinging my face. I thought; What in the world? It is a nice day, where did that come from?  I looked in the direction of \"B\" Dorm and saw a low wall of dust coming towards me as if propelled by some unseen force and when it hit me I had to shield my face and eyes.  It was not really a high wind, but just propelled along by some force other than high wind if that makes any sense and when it hit me it felt very cold or extremely cool. I looked up to check the sky wondering if some storm was blowing in out of nowhere. But to my amazement the sky was mostly clear, but something immediately caught my eye when I looked up.  A dark sort of a dirty grey cloud tinged in pink was going over at a good clip.   But what struck me as odd was not only the fact that it was close to the ground, maybe a couple of hundred yards, but that it was going along at a fast pace, much faster than a normal cloud, even in a storm, but also that it was shaped so funny.  I wondered about such a strange looking, lonely storm cloud to be skipping across the country side at such a good speed all by itself in an otherwise clear sky?!?   As I stood and stared at it for a moment as it flew along over the \"camp\" (slang name for a prison) it I noticed a group of officers, \"Yard Rovers,\" standing in the prison yard a hundred yards away watching it intently also. I then turned and went on into the dorm to continue our count. But others watched it until it was out of site (see below). But it was shaped so funny that it stuck in my mind for the next few hours and sort of worried me like something nagging at the back of your mind. It was as I said a dirty, very dark grey like a storm cloud and had a pinkish tint in places, especially along the underside. It was not shaped like any cloud that I have ever seen. It was almost like a big wedge the size of two or three houses end to end, the pointed or narrow end to the front, the aft end sort of flat or squared. And above this aft end was a section of it, of \"cloud \",  that was sort of like a diamond or triangular shape, almost reminding one of the tail section of a rocket or plane. All along it and especially the aft end of it were sort of like tendrils hanging along being tugged at by the air as it went along, as if the vapors were being sucked off by the passing air or wind and being constantly rejuvenated.  Sort of like, if one can imagine it, a block of dry ice flying along with its vapors enfolding around it and flitting around and from it with the wind.  That stuck in the back of my mind about how it looked to me. Then a bit later a single word came to me, \"artificial!\"  That was what I was trying to think of , what was nagging at me!  It had almost an artificial look to it!!  Maybe I have been a \"Trekky\" too many years, studying space travel, reading up on and being a fan of things like \"Star Wars\" and \"Star Trek.\"   But the terminology on Star Trek used for the technology for a space ship to able to hide from radar and from visionary detection, basically being able to become invisible at will, is called a \"Cloaking Device!\"  Something similar is what the United States was trying to perfect with the \"Philadelphia Experiment\" during WWII. That experiment failed as far as I know and cost the military some lives. But not wanting to be laughed at I kept all these thoughts, uneasy feelings, and observations to my self for fear of being ridiculed. But as it turns out I was not the only one who had witnessed it!   Later, as the day was winding down, and I having forgotten it,  three of the yard rovers stopped in our dorm on their rounds and sat down to take a slight pause, or break, to rest their feet and began going on about something..  It dawned on me that they were chattering about the same thing I had seen!  But they had more to tell;  One commented on the coldness that hit them, and how without any real high wind a wall of slight debris and sand came at them also, sort of along of and in front of this so called \"cloud.\"  They agreed that it was sort of like the \"fore blast\" in front of a helicopter or hover craft of some sort, but not as violently thrown as a helicopter does.  Someone else asked if anyone else noticed the orange plastic barrier to the construction area sort of just wrinkle up and roll up and over into a ditch, but with no real high wind to make it do so, just that sort of uncanny cold air and slight breeze that went along in front of the \"cloud.\" One officer was asking did the rest of us notice how the so called cloud, or cloudlike substance around it,  kept folding in on itself, sort of like renewing itself or something.  Another officer said that she thought from the beginning that it was some sort of secret, or even alien, craft in some sort of disguise and that when it went on over them she intently tried to look at the back of it to see if there was the \"back\" or aft end of some sort of craft visible.  She said that the cloud, or vapors, just boiled down and over the back of it hiding the rear end, with the same tendrils of vapor or cloud that I had seen trailing behind it.   And then they all agreed very excitedly that when it went over and across the open area of the prison that the \"fore blast\" of breezy dust and all preceded it and when it crossed over a tree line of tall trees the tops of those trees went crazy jiggling and swaying very fast back and forth, and as soon as it passed this movement ceased.     That last bit of info sort of puts me in mind of the reports that at so called UFO landing sites it has been found that the molecular structure of plant material in the area had been changed or altered!   One of the rovers said that he had been going to the Back-Gate at the time to let in the \"Farm Squad\" inmates. He chimed in and said that he had seen the same thing and now that he thought of it he agreed with all that they said. And he said that when he let the farm squad inmates in the Farm Boss asked him did he see that odd looking cloud flying fast across the camp?  This Farm Boss more or less saw and felt the same things too.  Of course by then I had chimed in with what I saw, my observations, and my feelings.   One of the officers, who is very interested in science, space travel, etc, as I am asked,\"Officer Edelen, did you get the definite feeling that it was a craft of some kind, somehow \"Cloaked\" or in some kind of disguise?  I readily agreed and we all more or less agreed that whether it was an alien UFO of some sort of a top secret craft of the United States, it gave us all the impression that it was a craft of some sort in some sort of disguise.  I of course even commented that I had read reports of alien craft that were not of solid material atoll but were known as some sort of plasma craft, possibly craft capable of traveling inter-dimensionally.   It does indeed appear to have been just that; some sort of artificial anomaly, or some sort of craft: One;  it was flying too fast,  Two;  it kept a set course until out of site,  and Three; it retained it shape until it was out of site.  And Four; one officer commented that she had studied its shadow for a moment.  She said the shape she had seen was not the obscured shape of an edgeless or uneven edged cloud but the definite shape of a hard craft of some sort.   And then they all agreed that they had seen  three Air Force jets, one behind the other, flying way up above the \"cloud\" but along the exact same course as if they were following it, hunting it, or possibly monitoring it.  At that time we called Channel 12 news and asked if anyone had reported seeing anything strange in the skies over Elmore, Autauga counties. The guy I spoke to said that at that time they had received no such reports.    Now these officers that saw this: I have right at14 years in with the Alabama Department of Corrections, and the others on up to near 20 yrs and over.  They all three are mature men and women and very serious, professional Correctional Officers, not given to flights of fancy and delusion and are trained both by not only APOST Certified Correctional Training but also by the training and intuition that years of service gives you to spot anything unusual and out of the ordinary and keep a level head while doing so, and to be able to mentally keep notes while doing so. And to top it all off this evening a 2nd shift supervisor called me at my home asking about the \"sighting,\" that some of our 1st shift officers that were working overtime on his shift had commented on seeing what we saw along with several inmates. I told him what we saw and he concurred saying that is what others there had told him. So I am tendering this report in the hopes that perhaps someone might find it interesting, might even already know about it, or to see if others have reported any thing similar.. Sincerely yours,   Elmore.,  Al.",

   "text":"BLACK CUBE UFO. It was a rainy night that night.  I work in a data center so I get off late at night.  Around 2:30am, I am standing outside smoking a cigarette.  The rain had subsided, but there were still strong winds being blown around in all directions.  I was speaking to a buddy on the phone looking out into the night sky.  The clouds were hanging low and the street lights were giving the clouds an eerie orange glow.  It also lit up the sky.  I caught something out of the corner of my eye moving from the North.  I am facing due West at this point.  It was just under the clouds and moving at a good pace, about 100mph if I were to guess.  It was traveling South just above 75 Central Expressway.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen, or may ever see in my life.  It was a black cube 80-100ft tall.  I was awe-struck.  I really sat and took in the moment even with my friend on the phone.  I knew this was special.  It didn't make a single noise and was about 500ft off the ground.  It literally looked like it was carved out of a rough black stone.  There were no lights to speak of.  There were no pipes or anything industrial on the outside of the craft. When the craft was directly in front of me I could clearly see the details.  The side facing me was framed on the edge.  I mean that it had a line carved into the stone that ran the entire edge of the side.  Within the framed edge was a circular pattern.  It was obvious to me that it was a deliberate pattern.  I can only say that it would take an understanding of mathematics to create the circle.  As it went from my right to left, North to South, it left a vapor trail that swirled in the disturbed air behind it.  Like I said, it made no sound.  It was absolutely huge.  The rain started to come down again as it left my sight.  I immediately told my friend to go outside as he was South of my location.  He waited out in the middle of his street for 20 minutes looking for it. He was never able t! o see it as conditions worsened with the rain.  I cannot stop ! thinking about this incident now.  I cannot stop looking for this craft.  It is monumental in terms of what kind of an impact this has had on my life.  This changes everything.",

   "text":"((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous source.  No dates provided.  PD)) Sightings of Cube, Triangle, Cigar, Diamond  ships over Winchester Massachusetts (near Boston) I have seen several objects which I believe may be UFO's.  I live on the flight path into Logan Airport in Boston and observe normal aircraft all the time on approach and take-off.   I also live near Hanscom Air Force Base and have observed military planes landing and taking off.  In the past few years I have been stargazing, when all of the sudden, some very bright objects high up in the sky will appear and seem to hover over the Boston area in the sky for a couple of hours.  I observed one of these objects very closely once for a few hours before it seemed to move away.  I used binoculars for a better look. The objects were very bright and very slow moving, but I could tell that they were moving slowly back and forth all over the sky.  It took several minutes for the object to cross the sky.  Then it would change corse and move a different direction for a while.  I looked through the binoculars and also when I squinted my eyes I could make out a triangular shape to the  bright object, and I thought with the binoculars I could make out some flashing lights on the ends of the points of the triangle and even a brightly lit cockpit area. (the object was small and very bright as if it was high up above the earth) Well above the aircraft routes.  It seemed to be observing us.  I have since taken more notice to the skies than in the past and have noticed several times some diamond and triangular objects and even a cube and cigar shape once.  They are all very high up but below the stars and above the planes.  They all move very slowly - and I do not know how to explain it.  But the object is too far away to be a plane and doesn't move fast enough, and too big from the viewpoint to be a star.  The fact that it moves slowly across the horizon and shifts position occasionally rules out that it is a star or planet. I do not know how to explain it except its a UFO.  All of these sightings in the past few years have been in winchester from my house.  But I did also see a cigar shape object with flashing multicolored lights pass overhead in Cooperstown New York.  It was the oddest thing I have ever seen.  And this one actually changed speed.  It moved slowy at first picked up speed, shifted positions, then finally sped off.  But it was moving much faster than a plane or military jet and was too high to be a plane.  And too bright and large to be a star/planet.

   "text":"When we lived in Kansas in the early 1960s, we as small children made forts in the wheat. We would stomp the wheat down to make square rooms, round and rectangular shaped rooms and we would connect the room together with hall ways.  One night I looked out of the kitchen window and saw a White cube that glowed like a light bulb.  It had a red light glowing on the inside of it.  The area was north of Great Bend, Kansas. There are or were quite a few radio towers there and one huge TV 2 tower.  The cube shaped thing flew around that radio tower like a moth flies around a light bulb of all things, only slower than a moth and it never hit the tower.  I ran to the bath room to get my dad but he said don't brother him.  So I ran back to the kitchen yelling for my two brothers to come here.  When I got back to the window it was still flying around the tower.  Just before my brothers got to the window it came across the field towards me in a blink of an eye it was hovering around 75 feet above the ground.   That is when my two brothers made it to the window and started saying what is that, what is that.  The thing hovered there but very slowly turned for 20 sec. or so.  Than it spun so fast that it turned into a ball and was gone in a streak almost straight up but a little angle towards the n.w.  True true true story.  Also, I might add that the red light was fading on an off like the tower light was.  I believe it was trying to communicate with it and that it was surprised when it finally noticed me or us. I also think that it was some type of probe or something.  The work you are all doing is good work.  We saw what we saw so because of that I know we are not alone.  Sure makes you wonder why that thing was flying around that radio tower?  I don't think that making those forts in the wheat had or has anything to do with it but then again you never know like anything there are more questions than answers.  This was a real deal and I know with all the liars and hoaxes you have to be careful. But this one is true and! I hope it will or it may not help you.  Sincerely; WM  PS It was the size of a small box truck.

   "text":"Several orange lights flying separately and in triangular formation, accompanied by a loud roaring noise We were all inside (2 adults, 3 kids) watching TV after dinner.  My husband went outside to smoke a cigarette, and while he was outside there was a loud roaring noise that came from outside the house.  It sounded like a huge snow plow pushing ice off the road, but the roads are clear.   My husband banged on the window for me to come outside, saying there were strange lights in the sky. I went out onto the front porch, facing East, and saw at least 4 rapidly moving lights in the sky.  Our children joined us outside as well. The lights were moving from West to East, and were orange.  The lights were larger than the stars but smaller than the moon, and they moved very fast, crossing from the West horizon to the East horizon before turning around again in less than ten seconds.   We live in a mountainous area, in a valley which makes our view somewhat restricted, but in the sky that we see the lights were crossing  from one end to the other much faster than planes fly overhead, and there were no clouds blocking our view. It was incredibly cold and clear. When we first saw the lights, there were four and they were flying separate from each other.  Two of the lights moved towards each other and at first seemed to merge and become one slightly larger light before separating again and then appearing to zigzag around each other like they were tracing a double helix.  When the lights were separate, they appeared to blink, but when they came together they stayed solid.  At one point, a third light joined the first two lights, and then all three formed a triangular formation and flew in that pattern for about 20 seconds.  Again, while flying together, they stayed solid and did not blink.  The lights then broke away from each other and made hairpin turns very quickly and moved back towards the West.   As they moved West, they were again blinking and flying in zigzags around each other.  There was a fourth light at this time, that appeared to follow the first three.  This light looked like it was actually 4 smaller lights closely together in! a cube formation, and these appeared to be green.  The small green cube followed more slowly behind the first three, and they all moved towards the Western horizon.  The whole time these lights were moving, there was a loud roaring coming from the sky that was loud enough to shake the windows in the house, and the closer the lights got to the horizon the softer the roaring was until the lights and the noise stopped. We all went back inside, and about 10 minutes later, we heard the roaring start again, so we ran back out onto the porch looking back towards the west, which is towards the back of our house looking towards the treeline.  The roaring continued for about a minute, then abruptly stopped for about 30 seconds, started again for about a minute then abruptly stopped again, repeating this pattern several times.   While we heard the roaring, we could see lights moving over the horizon towards the West, but they were blocked by the trees so we couldn't see if they were in a formation or be sure of how many there were.  This episode lasted for about 3 minutes before the roaring stopped abruptly one final time and did not begin again.",

I walked out on my back porch to smoke a cigarette and noticed a bright light threw the only tree in my yard toward the east.  I didnt think too much of it just figured it was the moon or a plane.  I finished smoking and turned to walk back in but it caught my eye again only this time it was a little higher threw the tree.  I really didnt want to be too curious knowin i had to get up at 600 to go to work but I had to see what it was because i knew a plane should have already been past it was just moving too slow.  I walked to the end of my porch and could see it threw the very end of the branches it appeared to be movin but i just told my self it was probably a breeze moving the leafs.  I focused on several different leafs and none of them were moving.  I went out to my shed and proped myself agianst it and lined the object up with the corner of the building and saw then it was moving without a dout.So i went in grabbed my long range rifle with a very high quality scope and bipod because it looked like a very bright star it was just too big.to be a star.  When i set the rifle up and zoomed in as far as i could.  When i looked at it threw the scope i could see it wasnt a star a all. I could see a clear shape of the object and what really stood out was 3 short black lines about 1/4 the way up on the craft from the bottom.  It was saucer shaped up to these lines and domed shape above them.  The color would be light i guess i have never seen anything like it in my life the whole object was bright white like it was being illuminated from the inside.  That's the only way i know how to describe it.  I cant explain how the three black lines were stood out so much on something that bright.  I guess the eye relief on the scope really helped.  I could see the  object was moving almost like a car would if u popped the clutch.  Then it would stabilize and not move any then do the same thing looked very deliberate but not like u would think anything functioning correctly would. It would move west every time.  And through the scope it sometimes would fall out of the recital like a stalled plane would do. I went and woke my wife she watched it awhile then became concerned and wouldn't come back out. It was very very high. I watched it for about a hour moving sporadically but still maintaining its westerly course. Then it stopped and im not sure if it turned or what but it looked like a cube just kind of all of a sudden. It stayed like this for probably ten min and never move inch. I was beginning to wonder what was going on i thought i was loosing it but a very light purple cloud formed under the cube i guess it had to be exhaust. I guess it rotated or something but i could see the original shape once more only the upper part of the craft was very light purple color. It kept movin westward very verly slow then just vanished. there wasnt a cloud in the sky and i never saw it agian. I dont understand what all i saw but the movements were too deliberate to be natural. The light it was putting off was ve! ry very bright i cant understand how the whole object was that bright. To the naked eye it looked like a huge very bright star but that scope told me a different story and i wish i could comprehend what i saw. Thats the best i know how to explain it never seen anything similar in my life. It is what it is.  What that is. Heck if I know.",

   "text":"Saw a greyish black stretched cube with rounded corners with bright white windows on it UFO Sighting by my Cousin My cousin is a nine year old male.  He lives in the northeast US.  He claimed to have seen a UFO on two occasions near his home. Incident #1 Date:  Actual date isn‚Äôt exact though he remembers somewhere in mid January 2009. Time of day: approximately 7PM Location: My cousin was out in the yard playing with his 2 dogs, a golden retriever and a chocolate lab.  He claims that the dogs actually spotted (or heard? or sensed?) the UFO before he did which drew his attention to it.   He spotted a UFO hovering just below the tree line that was shaped like a ‚Äústretched cube‚Äù (rectangular block shaped) ‚Äì the trees were approx 80-90 ft tall (estimated).  My cousin estimated that the UFO was about 1000 ft away from himself.   The grayish-black (charcoal) colored UFO looked like a ‚Äúsquare house with rounded corners with lighted square windows all around it on every side except for the top and bottom which had smaller round white lights‚Äù.  The UFO then came above the tree line and started doing different flipping and turning movements.  He said it didn‚Äôt look like or act like a plane or a helicopter or anything that we know of or make in the US.  He described the pattern of bright white lights along the windows as going all solid and then flashing very quickly in an ordered sequence one after the other and then back to solid.  The lights on the top also flashed in the same pattern.  He claimed that after the craft went above the tree line that it was ‚Äúwatching him‚Äù and sort of ‚Äúshowing off‚Äù as it did its maneuvers.   He estimated the size of the craft as approximately 30-40 feet long and about 10 ft high.  He mentioned that it spun slowly 3 to 4 times on different axes (Y then X and then like a 45 (or 135) degree angled axis).  He noted that after spinning on one axis that it would very quickly move linearly to another position and then spin slowly on a different axis.  Both dogs were trying to get inside the house when the craft appeared.  They were barking and yipping to get inside the house and didn‚Äôt appear comfortable around the UFO.  This whole event lasted for about 3-4 minutes.  He didn‚Äôt hear any sound at all though because his dogs were barking loudly so that pretty much dominated any audio.  However he noted that he didn‚Äôt hear any loud jet-lane type noises.! He men tioned that while the UFO was in the tree line of pine trees that the branches were shaking and shuttering.  He only watched for 4 minutes and then went inside because it was unnerving.  And after inside the house he looked again quickly and it was gone.  He told his parents who didn‚Äôt believe him which is why I am penning this for him (Uncle Age 43) Incident #2 Then about 1.5 months later he claimed to have seen it again in the same spot though only for about 30 seconds this time.  The UFO appeared to execute the same maneuvers as described above in the first incident. He drew some pictures that depict the UFO and how it turned axially and also the lights on the side. My cousin gets good grades in school and isn‚Äôt lying about this.

The first night I saw the object it landed in the woods behind my house.  I woke up my wife and then she saw it with me as it left.  Then about 2 nights later, around the same time, we again witnessed about 2 of these flying, flashing white lights at different locations in the tree line of the woods.  We tried to video tape them but it just came out dark.  The tape sounds like the Blair Witch Project.  I saw it one more time in the beginning of this month, September 2008, in the yard again next to my pool again around 3 am.",

Didnt look like anything any of us had ever seen.  Someone inland fired up a spotlight and pointed it at the clouds below the object.

While we were stopped in heavy traffic, the 2nd \"copter\" swayed erratically from side to side above the busy highway.  It stopped suddenly in mid-air, then turned sharply toward the east, all the while rapidly changing altitude.  It continued to sway from side to side and to bounce up and down. We could see it was not a helicopter, but was an extremely large cube or boxy silver object.  It morphed into an elongated box, then became a sphere and then a whole array of boxy shapes, as it hovered, and raised and lowered its altitude.  We saw no lights on it.  There were no vapors coming from it.  When it changed shape it would momentarily shine like a piece of reflective aluminum. Finally it just shot off to the northeast at a high rate of speed.  I was driving and had to focus on traffic, but my husband in the passenger seat watched the object until it disappeared completely.  The entire episode lasted approximately 5-10 minutes. It was high noon, the sky was a light grey, there was no rain, and no wind. Visibility was about five miles.",

Once focused on the object I noticed it was slightly glowing but I only really saw it because the moon was so bright. It was traveling north to south and only through the moonlight did i notice it also had a tail. To be honest it moved just like a meteor but it was so close i could actually see the object. It was bulky in shape almost cubed and left a trail but not a light trail like a meteor it was almost like a smoke trail like a plane would leave but it disappeared very quickly. It looked more like it was just moving so fast it was displacing the atmosphere around it. I would have said it was a meteor but I saw that low flying meteor that passed through the atmosphere back in late '09 and it lit up the entire! sky so I don't believe that this was the same case. This was a big chunk of something that darted across the sky almost invisible. I don't know if this site checks air traffic in the area of these occurrences but I would just like to know what it was thanks.",

On Saturday February 1, 2014, at 3:43 pm north Fresno, CA, I saw what at first I thought was a large black bird coming from the west toward me and my wife, but as I looked it did not have flapping wings.  It did change shape somewhat, not much.   I went into my garage and retrieved my 50X binoculars to get a better look.  What I saw was a black object that seemed to be a jumble of mix of cubes and other shapes mostly black but not completely.  It looked as if it was mottled with black and no color.  The object was tumbling with the sun reflecting and this was why it appeared to be changing shape.  I came to the conclusion that it must be a bunch of balloons as the tumbling seemed to be effortless.   As I was breathing heavy from yard work it was hard to get a very stable look with the binocular.  I looked around to find something stable my shaking.  Not finding anything I looked up without the binoculars and could not find it.  I asked my wife where it was as she was watching it only with her eyes.  She said it just disappeared, was there and then gone.   The object was traveling west to east at about 25 mph and was about 500 feet above us.  The weather was clear and no wind at all.  The object appeared to have a flat path not going up or down.  It‚Äôs hard to say what size it was but I would guess it was 20 feet across.  It was not a uniform shape.  Also no sound.",

This object was really high in the sky, above the approach that airliners take to DFW or Love field. At first I thought it must be the blimp ready for the Dallas game that day.

I couldn‚Äôt make out much detail but it seemed to have what I would call notches like a cube on it. At this time the light turned green and we drove due north, at this time my daughter saw a jetliner on approach to DFW and it was way below the alt of this thing.

I wouldn‚Äôt call it a ball of light.  I would say it was like large sausage shaped lights entwined into each other it was a sunny day and my hallway is dark it came from my bathroom, I would not say it floated it seemed to have a motion like the sausage lights were moving within the shape of a rounded off cube.  There were no hard edges and the lights within the shape moved as it was going from one room to the next. At first thought I thought it was bluish lights on some of these sausage shapes and some were perfectly white.  Luminescent.  It seemed to hover for a second and I had a strange feeling it was intelligent. I know that people are starting to think I am crazy.  That is okay by me.  I just know that someone out there has seen something like this. I have also had some crazy stuff happening at home.  Something said something in my ear while I was lying down.   My dog who was beside me heard it and started to bark like there was someone in the room.  It was loud and I could feel it down my ear canal.  I have been researching to see if someone had died in this house but I have come up with no explanation. I think all this started to happen in the last few years when I saw a round object in the day sky go over my backyard. It had a military plane a few hundred feet above it. My husband was in the living room with me when I watched the handle on my sun porch move and the door opened.  He heard the handle and went over to check it.  No explanation for that either.  I am getting scared as I am alone a lot.

First object at first a large white orb of light emitting two light blue colored beams of light.  Other objects dirigible in shape with lights changing from red and green to blue and magenta in a pulsating fashion. 5 minutes later, first object begins landing process, as it gets closer to the ground, true shape is revealed to be a disk 25 feet in diameter, jet black in color, with cube shaped constructs on top of it. 3 minutes later, alien craft lands on the ground, with the 2 other objects orbiting above it. 2 minutes later, at 2:25 AM, I rushed across the highway to observe the craft up close.  At 2:30 AM, began to slowly move towards the craft, and one minute later, came into physical contact with the craft. Surface of the craft is smooth and metallic to the touch with no scratch marks or indentations on it.  No hieroglyphics or symbols on the surface as well. White light se! en beneath the craft. 2 other craft still seen orbiting above the main craft. After 12 minutes of studying the landed craft, the craft began making a humming noise, possibly signaling the start of the launch.  Craft lifts up 20 feet into the air, shining the two beams of light, operating them somewhat like searchlights.  Light beams move around in sweeping motion until one of the lights converges on me followed by the other.  Lights focused on me for 30 seconds, then turned off.  The main craft floats up to the 2 other craft and at 2:45 AM, all 3 craft fly off to the Northeast at a fast speed. Later returned to my apartment.",

   "text":"Craft with tan \"X\" on the bottom. Seen on 5 different occasions in 5 months. I have seen a particular ‚Äúcraft‚Äù five times in the last five months. I saw it again tonight at about 7:12 p.m. PDT. I would estimate its altitude at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The speed seemed to be about that of a commercial passenger jet. The lights on this craft are non-typical. There is a blinking blue-white light at the front. Then there a bar with several lights that are slightly orange (maybe about the color of tungsten lights), just past the center of the craft, that go laterally, and look like cubes placed side by side. They shine towards the front and back of the craft. There are no lights on this craft that are typical of normal aircraft navigational lights. It appears that the craft is black with a tan colored ‚ÄúX‚Äù painted on the bottom side. The ends of the X shape are at the front and back of the craft. This craft makes no sound that I can detect.  All five times I have seen the craft it has been moving from North to South, and at different altitudes. My sighting of it have all been at night, shortly after the sun has set and it is complete dark outside.  The first time I saw this craft was in late May or early June, and I have seen it four times, about once a month, since then. The first time I saw it, I happened to look up, and it had passed right over the top of where I was standing. It was moving fairly slowly, and made no sound that I could hear. I have not been able to see the actual outline shape of the craft against the night sky, but it appears to be either flat on the bottom, or possibly slightly concave. It is many times wider than a normal airplane or jet.  In hindsight I should have recorded the times and dates of the previous sightings of this craft, or made reports on them.  Another report of a craft that might be similar can be seen here:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58560.html",

I was driving north on La Cienega at around Wilshire.  Two helicopters patrolled the area, and 1 plane descended slightly in it's flight path, possibly to avoid the object.  After remaining stationary for just about 30 seconds, it began to move again, towards downtown (to my right at the time).  While driving, I lost sight of the object behind trees and buildings.  Approximately 20 minutes later, at about 4:45PM, I was heading into downtown LA towards the central library.  I was just exiting the 10 West onto the 110 North.  As I came around the curve, I saw the object again, exactly as before, in the skies above the city to the north, northeast of route 110 (a little ahead and to the left of the highway from my perspective.  I looked around at other vehicles and nobody seemed to notice it.  Behind me in a white/cream colored volkswagen station wagon, were a couple in their late 60's, early 70's.  They saw the object also, but exited at 9th St.  I continued on the 110 to the 4th street exit, and as I did so the object came much nearer to the roadway.  It was very large, massive is the word that I kept thinking.  The closer it got to me, it looked less and less round, and I could identify individual colors, including red and black.  The object was a structure, for certain, and was vaguely cube shaped.  There appeared to be some sort of boom, or large metal pole hanging down below the craft.  It did not look aerodynamic at all.  It kept a solid form, and did not waver, heading in a straight line.  It was was too big and way too stable to have been balloons blowing in the wind.  It floated overhead, and I lost sight of it as I took the 4th street exit.  I was back on the 110 heading south again 20 minutes later, and did not see the craft in the sky.",

About 23:45 hours on above date I recieved a call from a family member.  The family member was hysterical about a supposed UFO near our location.  This family member indicated that there was a UFO hovering over a major hotel in the area, that dozens of people had pulled over to watch it and that it showed no sign of leaving.  Myself and two other family members quickly got into a vehicle and drove to the location they were at.  While we were in transit, we saw a strange helicopter approach the area and alternatingly hover and search. This helicopter had the apparent length of a CH-47 military helicopter, but was unidentifiable due to lack of lighting.  It had none of the regular blinking red lights, but had alternatingly green, orange, and blue bright lights flashing in a regular pattern.  It appeared to have some sort of attached storage device under it, cube or rectangular shaped. The light configuration and storage construct was unlike anything I had seen before.  The altitude of the helicopter was about 75 meters.  The helicopter was there from about the time I recieved the call (possibly earlier) and bugged out at approx. 0010 hours in a N/NW direction. We approached the location my family member gave me and parked alongside 9 other vehicles, each with 2-5 people in them all looking in the same direction.  We personally were unable to see the UFO as it left minutes before we arrived.  We stayed for about 45 minutes and it did not reappear. The family member that called me took video on her cellphone and upon getting home, we loooked online and there was already one other video of the event posted. On a perhaps unrelated note, a cell phone in the house at 2232 hours experienced service interruption and emitted an electronic tone I have never heard before.  The tone sounded like the hybrid tone of a dial up phone, but without the tempo or form associated with that normal tone. The cell phone video my family member took is available if needed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

On 15 August 2008, from approximately 6:25pm to 6:30pm, I observed an unusual object in the sky while I was driving home from work.  I had just merged onto SR429 from the Florida Turnpike, heading north toward Apopka, Florida.  The weather was partly cloudy, but it was not raining, and visibility was good.  Looking out my driver‚Äôs side window (toward the west), something in the sky caught my attention. An incredibly bright, white object appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky at what I would estimate to be 700ft to 800ft in altitude.  My initial reaction was that the object was probably an airplane reflecting sunlight while banking, but after continuing to observe it, I quickly realized that was not the case. The object appeared to be perfectly square in shape, not a cube, but a flat, square shape.  It was smooth, with very clearly defined perimeter lines and corners, and was a very brilliant color of white;  incredibly bright, but in a different manner than the brightness of the sun (very comfortable to look at, no glare associated with it, and its brightness did not obscure its shape at all; there was no  \"halo\" or other glow surrounding it in spite of its brightness).  It seemed to be illuminated from inside of the object, even though the object was so flat that it appeared to be almost two dimensional.  The object was located well below the cloud cover, and stuck out like a sore thumb against the overcast, grey sky. I would estimate my distance from the object to be at least one mile.  I‚Äôm not sure I can accurately estimate the size of the object, but my impression was that it was fairly large given that I could clearly see the outline of its shape at that distance.  The best description I can give regarding its size is that if you held your thumb up at arm‚Äôs length, the object would appear to be slightly smaller than your thumbnail. The object was absolutely stationary in the sky; no movement whatsoever for the entire period that I observed it (at least 5 minutes).  While observing the object, I noticed a small, round flashing light that appeared to be further west of the object, but moving toward it.  When the flashing light had almost reached the bright, square object, they both disappeared.  I spent several minutes trying to spot them again, but they never reappeared.",

I thought it might b a nuke.  Then I saw two fighter jets fly toward it then it dissapeared.  The smoke trail it left was incredible. Figure eights, zig-zags, then at the top a perfect 3d cube.  None of our phones would work to take a pic.  Well bout five to nine fighter jets began flying straight up then down and all over all morning.  I was in seven 11 parkin lot n pointed them out to bystanders, who at the time were oblivious.  they were shocked at the site of the fighter jets.  I was so excited by the incident, that i called my dad to tell him of the events, n to c if he could see the jets.  I called my exgirlfriend who lives in philadelphia, n she said there were a bout 8 fighter jets in the sky up there, this was around 9a.m.  My dad called back and said there had been a newsflash of the reports.  The media said that the government shot off two missles off of an island off of virginia.  They made no mention of why, and made no other mention of it.  They blamed the smoke trail on the weather.  The smoke trail itself was incredible because it sat in the air for a good ten minutes.   i have met six other people than my friends that witnessed the same event.  The fighter jets were in the sky until dark.  My exgirlfriend told me that she saw on the news that they were saying they released a new fighter jet that day, explaining why they were in the sky.  Y did the government shoot off rockets for no reason, then have fighter jets go after it.  The hole the others from the ohare airport describe sounds similar to ! the ligh t n how it dissapeared.  It was the most amazing thing my eyes have seen.  They cant deny the truth forever. 1 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides only telephone number.  The missile launch occurred at approximately 07:00 hrs.

It was Seen Several more Times over the Summer and on a Very Cloudy Night it was Seen by many People in Town Shining a Beam down into the Water. On July 2nd  2011 18:00 hours, Overcast, I Witnessed from Indian Point an Orange ball UFO over Pagan Point, Travelling slowly South to North along the Beach followed by a Flash of light, then I Felt this Very Powerful Wave of Emery go by Me and an Object Dropped from the Sky, By then the UFO Disappeared. The Next Day July 3rd 2011 08:00 hours, Overcast, I went Out to the Area to Find what ever had Fallen from the Sky near the UFO. The First thing i Found was a Meteorite looking, Soft Ball sized  Rock (1468g) with makings like a Space Capsule Heat Shield with Fresh Reentry Burns and Looks just Like an ALIEN EYE looking at You and A Map of our Solar System. Next to the First Rock was a Second Meteorite looking Rock the Size of a Golf Ball (166g) with a Very Dark Green Colour and a Texture like Reptile Skin. The Third Rock Inches away is a Bust (1466g) of a Reptilian King on one Side and the Queen on the other side Both with a Crown and a Horn on Top of the Head plus Teeth. (Very Creepy)  The Fourth Rock was Found Earlier in the Year. A local News Paper did a Story on the find a Basket Ball sized Rock/Meteorite 20kg (Now broken-up) With vanes of Gold, Silver and Copper. The Gold and Copper is in the Shape of Perfect 'Borg' Cubes, the Silver flows like Water. I Think this is an Area that Attracts Dimensional UFOs & Hitchhikers like Meteorites and Space Junk. I Would love to See that is Inside the Rocks, But after Seeing the History Channels Ancient Aliens on Plagues that May half Come from Meteorites this is Very Scary.",

   "text":"The Lights Over the Great Salt Lake and West Desert On Wednesday, May 4, 2011 at approximately 9:30pm on my return home from the gym I parked my car in my driveway facing towards the western sky.  I was talking to a friend on my phone when I noticed in the dark bluish skies a stationary changing light.  It was quite familiar to me, because over the past couple of years family members and I have seen these lights.  But, the difference this time was that these lights were much closer than previous sightings. I quickly ended my phone conversation and ran inside to tell my Father and grab my new camera (Canon Powershot ELPH 300 HS) that I had purchased about a week previous.  Both of us went to the back porch overlooking the Great Salt Lake and Antelope Island.  I attempted to take a still picture of the object, but was unable to capture anything visible.  Not having used my video feature yet, I tried recording a video which I did with much better success. I recorded six segments of video on my camera from lengths of about 1:30 to 8:00 minutes long.  We both made observations on the closeness of the object (approximately 75 miles from our location).  Because of the closeness of the object we could see a better view of the rotating lights and movement  of the craft from previous sightings. We could see the distinct rotation of the craft that made it look like a tumbling Rubix's cube.  It seemed to stay stationary in the night sky.  If there was movement it was slight and westward.  The lights on the object changed frequently between reds, blues, oranges and greens.  It looked as though it was moving in a Disco light fashion, very fast and very rapid.  Occasionally the middle of the object would pulsate into a black circle and then retract. We observed this object for approximately 25 minutes until the light got more and more faint into the night sky.  We couldn't determine if the object was moving westward over the Great Salt Lake or Dugway Testing Center.  But, there were no sudden movements or set orbit during those 25 minutes.  We couldn't imagine this was an aircraft even though the Salt Lake International Airport and Hill Air Force base are nearby.  We ruled out a planet, because of the tumbling rotation and brilliant lights.  It could easily be a drone observing something, possibly towards the Dugway Testing Center?    Whatever it was we have been seeing this object over the west skies of the Great Salt Lake and Dugway Testing Center the past couple of years.  Nothing as close as we saw on the night of May 4, 2011.   I would love any logical explanation.",

   "text":"Mysterious black rectangular object in the North Charleston sky. Hi, I'm an area manager for a small chain of stores in Mt. Pleasant and Charleston County, SC.  Well yesterday, 11-1-09, I was driving home to North Charleston from one of our stores loacted in Mt. Pleasant.  I always take the 526 home to North Charleston.  It was just before sunset yesterday and as I was driving I saw the strangest thing in the sky.  It looked like a black rectangular object that wasn't moving, way up in the sky against the clouds.  I thought \"what the heck is that?\" and had to keep driving but I did slow down some.  There is no safe place to pull off the road once on the 526.  Well I kept watching it and watching it as I drove.  I believe I saw another craft of some sort up way, way above it and to the right of it and this smaller, harder to see craft may have been plane shaped.  I began to think things.  I thought that maybe there was a helicopter or plane towing something. But I really didn't see a tow chain or rope of any kind between the two, but that's what it looked like.  Now my immagination went wild and I want to say it reminded me of the Star Trek Enterprise pulling the borg cube with a tractor beam! Seriously, I thought well there must be a logical explanation.  I thought the airforce might have been doing some scientific experiment and may have dropped or pulled something from behind a plane or helicopter as a weather/wind experiment or something like that.  I thought well maybe one of those planes that pull an advertisement sign behind it like those I see off the beach when I go to Daytona. I just don't know anything.  Now I want to believe that it was a spaceship from outerspace with extraterrestrials on it.  I really, really do!  All I really know for sure however is that I saw something in the sky that didn't seem to be moving at first, like a black, rectangular window against the white clouds way high up that day.  Then I saw the other thing, the maybe plane shaped craft.  Now the black object either turned and narrowed, or as I drove foreward I saw from a different angle and it narrowed.  I believe they started to slowly move and eventually I lost sight of them because I entered into my own neighborhood and trees blocked any further view of them.   As soon as I got home yesterday I wrote to MUFON and a representative from MUFON called me last night.  Today I told my boss about the incident and I even tried to contact the Charleston Airforce base to ask if they had anything unusual or unexplained on their radar over North Charleston yesterday, but I cou! ldn't find an e-mail addy that would do any good.  I watched and looked at the thing for a good fifteen minutes on my way home on this 526.  There were plenty of other cars on the road and I'm surprised nobody else noticed, if they did, they didn't post a report about it.  Well I'm a definate believer.  I'm convinced!  I am not a skeptic.  I believe in UFOs and in extraterrestrial life.  I've seen too much not to be a believer.  I sure intend to keep on watching the sky!",

The anomaly was unlikely a form of lightning, due to the duration, size, and shape. The ‚Äòlight‚Äô, which again was a massive strobe, could be described as; oval or circle or rectangle (or even square) (to match a best description of its top-down (or ground-to-air view, bird‚Äôs eye from the ground, etc.)).  The SIZE description as; massive, football field (much larger ‚Äì 3 to 4 times this size or even larger).  The size of the entire light portion of the ‚Äòcraft‚Äô (the defined shape, most notably ‚Äòrectangle‚Äô/futbol field with a ‚Äòcentral sun‚Äô or ‚Äòfocus point‚Äô (seemingly the witness‚Äô location, but at a height of only about 60-100 feet above) low in the clouds (clouds fast moving, ‚Äòfocus point‚Äô occulted by the cloud cover, although cloud cover not total ‚Äì moon waning, shining in the west). Also notable about the consciousness of the witness ‚Äì the awareness at the time of ‚ÄúIndians‚Äù.  Not ‚ÄúIndia‚Äù such as Kashmir, but of the Native American Indian.  The ‚Äòawareness‚Äô, ‚ÄòESP‚Äô, ‚Äòtele‚Äô, etc. was certainly ‚Äòdulled‚Äô at the time of the event, but included subconscious notable features; Indians, Redskins, Native American Indian, American Dream, American Spirit, American Spirit (cigarette) (natural tobacco), Football Field, Redskins vs. Cowboys, Star (5 points), Cube Form (RGIII, (playoff)), Washington Post, holiday time, new year (time for exposure for anomalies).  The subconscious ‚Äòtiming‚Äô of these events is believed by the witness to be ‚Äòdata‚Äô supporting the timing of the sighting, and the importance in the witness‚Äô own life (spiritual). It could also be reported and fit a description that a ‚Äúflying wing‚Äù (but massive in size and silent in sound) was moving at a very fast speed, engaged a light on/off (or simply sped up [down] and then up, and the light was never ‚Äòoff‚Äô).  Contrary to the physics of the last descriptive sentence (flying down, then up, with light on), the witness‚Äô account does not recall ‚Äòvertical‚Äô movement, but ‚Äòhorizontal‚Äô movement from North (but ‚Äòstarting‚Äô just South of the Airport), travelling Southeast (or travelling in a vertical direction, but ‚Äòthe light‚Äô expanding towards the Southeast (probably only an apparency of the witness‚Äô viewpoint) (also, the ‚Äòlight‚Äô was centralized like a candle flame is, only the light expanded ‚Äì so it is unique that movement was also sensed).  It can also be said that ‚Äòlack of movement‚Äô had caused a dizzying ‚Äòneed‚Äô or ‚Äòdeception‚Äô of movement, in which the witness may or may not have seen, but the ‚Äòelapsed time‚Äô of the light/strobe anomaly seemed more ‚Äòstill! ‚Äô. Nevertheless of the movement, the flash/ball/oval/field/rectangle blanketing WAS seen and realized, with almost definite ‚Äòsource‚Äô to the light, pinpointed near/above witness‚Äô location. Finally, it can be noted that the witness believes it is possible for the ‚Äúcraft‚Äù to belong to mankind, but if so, secret/not public knowledge.  It is doubtful, from the witness‚Äô consideration, that the ‚Äúcraft‚Äù (if in reality, a craft composed of matter, as explained above) is of primitive technologies (such as publicly known U.S. Military technologies).

A few steps ahead of me she called back me, \"Honey, what's that?\", fully expecting me to provide a comfortable and critical natural explanation for the large and very bright light in the sky.  Now standing at the front of the house and facing North I see a very bright sphere of light that I first assume is either a very near and low-flying aircraft or a very large fireball coming straight at us. I am an amateur astronomer and cosmology buff for over thirty years.  I am critical nearly to the point of cynical, yet I find myself refusing to admit that what we saw was anything other than unfamiliar or not earthly technology. Looking North from the Niagara River the object appeared about 5 degrees above Polaris and appeared to be getting closer as its size and brilliance increased.  A very bright orange/yellow it was similar in size and somewhat in color to the street light on the road in front of our house before it stopped approaching (or increasing in size).  It outshone the streetlight only seven meters away.  Until that moment I was getting a little fearful that this may be a city killer asteroid coming straight at us.  There was no sound and no trail behind it.  It was headed straight at us or it wasn't a massive bolide at all.  It appeared to slow or stop so the bolide question was answered. I opened the door to the house and yelled for the children (ages 8 and 30) to rush outside.  The object, now at its nearest, would no longer appear to be coming Southward toward us, but slip Westward at great speed, then stop, then slip on over some more, then stop.  It did this about eight times before remaining stationary.  The whole time it scintillated as the stars do above a moist sky.  The four of us stood there with our eyes trained on it while it begin to shrink and dim in spurts as though it may have been moving away from us the way it had been moving to the West with the jerky movements.  With each successive \"pulse\" it grew smaller and fainter.  It didn't seem like it was moving away.  It appeared more like it was just shrinking and fading. I have no idea of how large or distant the object was.  I'm no expert at scale. I can only relate the scale by saying the object at its most brightest and biggest was easily as large as my thumbnail with my arm outstretched in front of me.  I spent some of the night and this morning looking for news of sightings over anywhere from Niagara Falls to Ottawa.  I just can't seem to guess how far it was away. The light surrounded the object.  High humidity would have easily revealed beams of light from lamps as it did for every other passing aircraft that night and most nights. There were no beams, just a large, very bright scintillating light moving awkwardly through the sky. As I told my wife before sleep, I was so excited to have witnessed the event.  I didn't know what I invited my children to see.  Did I call my little boy outside to witness the end of his life by an asteroid, or was this an alien craft and what were their intentions?  It was all very exciting and terrifying at the same time.  I have never felt like that before.  Skeptics don't get much excitement. All my life I have wanted to see a \"UFO\".  Two weeks ago my wife and I and one of our sons observed a daytime object and actually had time to retrieve two sets of binoculars for further observation.  I was unable to explain what I saw.  It looked like a large building made of up compartments (cubes) or maybe like a bunch of buildings stuck together. It wasn't round anywhere.  The Sun reflected brightly from only one small part at a time as it moved across the sky.  The rest of it appeared a dark grey or black.  Without binoculars it simply appeared to be a small ball of light as you would expect from sunlight reflected from a metallic object.  It caught our attention in the first place because it was so high in the sky yet didn't appear to be moving (like all the rest of high-flying air traffic was doing).  It did move large distances in quick moments somewhat like the ball of light last night.  We lost track of it after each quick shot across some distance, then found it s! tationery ahead of the direction it seemed to go.  We lost it for good the third time. I told my son, \"You are so fortunate to have witnessed such a thing. That could very well have been people from another world!\".  Wow!  I never expected something like that to come out of this skeptic's mouth.  My childhood dream of seeing a UFO is now fulfilled - twice in one month.  Although my son (age 8) also has his own telescope and a very good knowledge of astronomy and cosmology, I don't think he entirely grasps the measure of what we witnessed together. I really don't know exactly what we saw, but I'm still sort of in a state of shock.  I woke up still excited from last night's events.  My wife and I can't stop remarking at how last night's viewing was the first time I did not have my cell phone with me. I could have recorded video...",

   "text":"Spotted black hovering UFO of unusual/hard to distinguish shape near parking lot, before flying away at high speed. This sighting was very much a spontaneous encounter on my part, and ended almost as quickly as it began.  I was in my car, parked outside a strip mall next to a park, with a Taekwondo studio and Scuba Diving store in front of me.  I had just dropped off a family member, and was reading a book for college while waiting in the vehicle for my family member to return in about an hour.  A friend called me on my cell phone; I became distracted from reading, and so we talked for about five minutes before the beginning of the UFO encounter.   I was casually looking outside at my surroundings without much attentiveness, when I spotted this apparent craft.  I did not actually think it was an aircraft at all, at first.  I was looking up at the dark/grayish clouds in front of me, and I glanced in the craft‚Äôs direction, thinking I had just seen a small dark break the clouds in my peripheral vision - as if I could see through to a darker cloud layer.  I was not at all alarmed, nor did I suspect it was a flying object.  I continued talking, and when I turned my attention to the area again maybe about 10 seconds later, I looked more closely, and noticed this was not a break in the clouds.  Something was definitely there, well below the cloud layer. I knew very quickly it wasn‚Äôt a bird or plane, because it was hovering completely motionless in the air.  My immediate assumption was that this was a helicopter, which is perfectly reasonable, as I see them fly by from time to time, even at this particular parking lot.   I like to check out aircraft whenever I seen them, so I asked my friend to wait a moment while I sat up closer to my dashboard to focus in on the supposed helicopter.  I saw it was smaller than a helicopter; it had no tail, no propeller blades or moving parts, and made no audible sound.  It was unusually difficult to make out its shape.  This may have been because of its size and the dark backdrop.   But I stared at it for maybe about 20 seconds as it hovered there in the sky, absolutely motionless, expecting it to move.  I was so surprised at how still it was, I even moved my head left to right, just to be sure I wasn‚Äôt somehow staring at a speck of dust on my windshield.  I am pretty sure it had corners; it was not an oval or sphere exactly, but it seemed like it was maybe rounded slightly.   I can‚Äôt say for absolute certain, like I said earlier, the shape was hard to make out - but if I had to guess, it was perhaps a cube or triangle with rounded edges.  Very dark ‚Äì basically black in color, and may have had a small gray or white marking on it, but I cannot say for certain as it could have been a reflection of the sky, if it was metallic.  But from my angle at least, I would describe it as fairly dull; a matte black. In terms of size, I would say it was one to two meters across, and one-half to one meter in height.   I was still on the phone, and began describing the object to my friend, who was listening closely, and became a little concerned for me.  I did not feel threatened by it, but was very curious nonetheless.  I sometimes keep a pair of binoculars in my glove compartment, and so I began quickly rummaging through papers, napkins, and tools I keep in there, while still keeping an eye on the object, only occasionally glancing into the glove compartment fo r a second or two.   I had two plausible explanations in my mind; it was either a big balloon of some kind, or a drone, but I wanted to find out for certain.   At the exact moment I thought that, it started to move slightly to the left, and then a second later bolted off at high speed, traveling backwards, away from me. It did not tilt, turn, or otherwise look like it had control surfaces or a propulsion system.  I became upset it was leaving, and I could not find my binoculars.  Still talking to my friend, I figured I took them out of the compartment a few months ago to bring on a boat trip, and forgot to return them.  The craft left the location pretty fast; in about 15 seconds, it was a tiny little dot, and disappeared somewhere behind buildings or trees.   I found it very unlikely to be a balloon because if it was, it probably would have been smaller and round, likely would have had a string or something attached to it, and would have been ascending at a constant rate, not to mention being bobbed and brushed by the wind - not sitting perfectly still in the air, before suddenly bursting off at a very high speed in basically one direction.   It is hard to guess how high and far it was from my location with only a limited number of items for a point of reference, but I would say no more than a quarter mile from where I was parked.  It was relatively low; my best guess, I would say between 6! 00 and 800 feet above the ground.   When it moved, it began gently, and increased speed very quickly.  I would approximate maybe 250 to 300 mph the last I saw it.  Also note, there was a young man, maybe about 25, sitting in his car parked next to me, but he was facing the opposite direction and was staring at his phone, so I did not bother to ask if he had also seen the craft after it had left.   As far as I could tell, we were the only two people in the parking lot capable of viewing the craft.   Once the surprise and adrenaline rush had worn down, I resumed my conversation with my friend, speculating what it could have been. I regretted not taking a picture with my phone, but on the other hand, it probably would have been too small to turn up as anything more than a few pixels on the image anyway.  I decided to take a picture at least of the sky conditions where the craft was, about five minutes after it left, to give some perspective as to how I saw it. The only plausible and conventional explanation I have was that it was a large, black, very fast moving drone, with long range wireless capabilities.  This is a suburban area, so it was hovering and passing over small buildings, houses, and some forested areas.  I have walked near the place where the craft was in the past, and I know there are some small fields and depressions in the ground, as well as a high school it most definitely would have passed over or near.  I do not know how long it was hovering there prior, but I know it sat still for at least the minute or two that I saw it from when I first glanced it in the sky.  For a craft that size and altitude, it should have had some light beacon to indicate its presence to other aircraft, and I would have expected it to be flatter with four or more distinguishable copter propellers if it was a drone.  This craft did not possess any of those features as far as I could tell, but I would be willing to accept a drone as a conventional answer.  I readily acknowledge that it is just an unidentified flying object.  I am not necessarily trying so suggest this was some event so extraordinary that it exceeds all conventional reasoning, nor that it is of extraterrestrial or otherwise supernatural origin.  It was certainly very odd though, and this is not the first instance in the time I have lived here that I have seen unusual or inexplicable aircraft. There was one other event that occurred on my thirteenth birthday when I was walking home from a store.  I was on the top of a hill nearing my neighborhood next to a forested area with only a couple sleepy houses to my right side, when I spotted a silvery metal craft, oval in shape flying over the forest, completely silent, and traveling at similar heights and speeds to this one. Unlike the case I am presenting here, I do have a picture of the actual craft itself (albeit a poor resolution one) taken from my phone, and posted on Facebook. In the original image, the craft was too small to see without zooming in, but it was nevertheless in the image.  I searched old data folders and even tried to revive the (now dead) phone I took the photo with to see if I could retrieve the original file, but unfortunately could not bring it back. In the Facebook photo of this somewhat similar craft, I enlarged the image of the craft and drew a red line indicating where it was in the image so t! hat people could view it more easily, but other than that, there was no editing or tampering concerning the image of the craft itself. Both that one and this one traveled in about the same direction, heading north-northwest. This was before drones (especially of that size) were commercially available as they are today. I have not made any case files on this previous sighting, and this is the first time I have reported a UFO, because I felt compelled enough to say this really was unusual enough to constitute a true UFO. After showing the first encounter to friends online, they did not believe me, thinking I had pocket lint on my camera, even though I assured them something was in the air. I dropped the topic, and rarely spoke of it again, but with this new sighting, it has made me think back on that experience. I am not suggesting there is any direct connection or correlation, but these events are similar in some ways, and this new encounter marks the second time I have seen! an unusual or unconventional aircraft in this area, seven yea! rs apart , in the same stretch of about 5 miles.

   "text":"I completed a report on your site over a year ago and it was very brief and not as descriptive as I should have been in my initial report.  But since the time of my sighting, I have left out so many other significant factors to that night/morning that I just felt compelled to write to you again and explain the whole event, as there is so much more to mention. I have talked about my experience with several people over the past several months and have been made fun of countless times by friends and co-workers, but I still feel the need to explain the whole story to get it off my chest. On 1/2/09, I received a call from a friend‚Äôs son, who begged me to come up to Lafayette CO, to watch some meteor showers after I got off of work.  It was on a Friday and I was very tired and did not want to drive up there and hang out that particular night.  But the boy who was 13 or 14 at the time kept insisting that I come up and stay the night.  In fact, her 2 other children got on the phone and begged to see me as well and after I spoke with them, I felt compelled to drive up there.  So I packed a bag and headed north from my house in Denver. I arrived at about 8:00pm-8: 30pm and it was cold and I was dragging butt after a long week.  The kids immediately asked me to run to 7-11 to buy firewood for the outdoor fireplace as it was going to be even colder later that night and into the early morning hours.  So I bought 3 or 4 bundles of wood for our night.  Upon our return from 7-11, we hung out for a while and planned our night and agreed that we (my friend and I) would get up around 3:00am-3: 30am to start making hot cocoa and coffee for the 4:00 am showers.  But at around 11:00pm-11: 30pm, the kids were very hyper and were not ready for bed by any means.  They asked me if we could burn one of the bundles of wood and sky watch for a while before heading to bed.  I hesitantly said yes but knew that I was fading fast and didn‚Äôt have much energy from a long week at work.  At any rate, I didn‚Äôt want to disappoint them, so we headed outside. Once we got the fire going and brought out blankets and snacks, my friend‚Äôs daughter (7 yr. old) climbed on lap to stay warm.  The 2 boys, I believe were 13 and 11 were running around singing loud and throwing things in the yard.  I was getting annoyed because I didn‚Äôt have the energy they had and I really wanted to just chill out and relax in quite and peace.  The little girl fell asleep in my lap almost immediately as she was bundled up well and was pretty warm.   About 10-15 minutes after she fell asleep, I saw a gray animal or \"something\" running in a very weird manner along the side of the fence.  Whatever it was, it used a hand as well as its legs to run and hop at the same time.  At first glance I thought it was a wild animal and as soon as I had that thought, I literally threw the girl off of me and yelled, \"What ((deleted)) was that?\"   This thing moved very fast along the fence and was gone in no time at all.   My friend had her back to the \"thing\" and the boys were running wild and didn‚Äôt see anything.  I was so freaked out; I didn‚Äôt want to stay out there anymore.  I told them what I saw and they kept asking questions and so on.  Finally, I said that I was going to go inside and sleep for a while because I was getting up at 3:00am-3: 30am to make the snacks and then to watch the showers.  Plus, we needed to save some of the wood I bought.  So the boys said that they were staying downstairs to watch movies with the intention of staying awake all night.  My friend, her daughter and I went upstairs to her bedroom and we all were going to sleep together in the same bed.  After we jumped into bed, I was on one end, my friend in the middle, and her daughter was at the other end snuggled up with her mom.  I fell asleep immediately. After sleeping for a while, I woke up freezing like I have never felt before. (I have lived in Colorado my whole life and never wore coats in the winter and would only wear jackets because I am always hot).  So I pulled the blankets up to cover myself up more.  As soon as I did this, I was immediately burning up.  I threw the blankets off of me, and I was freezing again.   By this time, I woke up because my face touched my arm, which was like an ice-cube.  My eyes opened and I rolled over to see a purple light hovering below the ceiling.  I tried to focus my eyes to understand what I was seeing, but I could never really make out what it was.  It just changed shapes and was hovering about 3 or 4 inches from the ceiling, closer to my side of the bed.  I watched the thing for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to get dressed and start making the coffee and snacks. 1/3/09  At about 3:40am, I woke up my friend and told her what happened in the bedroom and she decided to get up too.  I also told her that the boys were downstairs sleeping in the livingroom with the TV still on.  I told her to look for her video camera with the infrared feature so that we can have it for the showers.   Then it occurred to me that she may want a smoke before the kids got up (they didn‚Äôt know she smoked) so we decided to smoke first before getting any cameras together.  Besides, I‚Äôm not good with any kind of camera with the exception of a cell phone camera so this was going to be all on her to set that part up. This is the part that I originally reported to this site, but I left out some stuff so I need to re-tell the story. A couple of minutes before 4:00am, we went outside to smoke.  We were out there for a short while when I saw what looked like a flock of geese flying towards us.  I pointed in the direction of where I was looking and yelled, \"Look!\"   As soon as I said that, I then realized that this was not a flock of geese at all.  It was a triangular shaped object that was gray on the outside of the perimeter and on the bottom, but shiny black finish on the rest of it.   As soon as I told her to look, the thing changed direction a little and aimed its path towards us.  It was directly over us about 300-500 ft in the air and made no sound and was moving very slow.  I initially said that it was going 30-40mph, but it was going slower than that.  My friend stood there with her mouth open and totally freaked out and I started checking in with her because I thought she was going to start screaming or something.   By this time, we could see directly underneath this thing and again, it was gray, with a light at each point of the triangle, with a round \"portal\" in the center and some weird designs on the bottom.  It didn‚Äôt make a sound at all. It started moving in between her house and her neighbor‚Äôs house and I started to chase it.  When I started running after it, I knocked over the chairs on the patio and bumped the table really loud, when all of the sudden, it disappeared right in front of us.  The lights weren‚Äôt on, but something inside was illuminating the lights from within to let us know they were lights.  And it looked as though it was using our street lamps and porch lights to guide itself.  I know I said that we watched this thing for 7 seconds in the first report, but there was no way it could have been that short because of the detail we were able to extract from it.  That was one of the things that always bothered me about it my first report. It was more like 20-30 seconds. After it disappeared, we went in and woke up the boys first.  My friend said, \"That was the most amazing UFO I have ever seen.\"  We started telling the kids to get up in case it came back, and because it was time for the showers.  So after we got settled in our spots, the showers came down immediately.  During the showers, we saw more UFO activity with lights flying low all over the place and doing crazy maneuvers and indescribable movements. We would keep talking about it for the next 2 hours. So at about 6:00am-6: 30am, the wood was almost gone, the winds were picking up and some light snow started to fall. I told everyone that I was going back to bed because I really didn‚Äôt sleep much and I was freezing again.  So I went upstairs to lay down in my friend‚Äôs bed again alone.  The purple light was gone this time.  At about 7:00am, my friend came in to crash too for a while.  However, at 8:30am, I got up to go to the bathroom. In the bathroom, there are lots of windows to look at onto the front yard.  When I glanced out of one of the windows, I saw a light layer of snow (about an inch high) covering the ground, with a perfect circle partly on the grass, sidewalk, and street in her front yard.  There were no tire tracks, footprints of any kind or anything else near the circle or any other place out front. It was totally untouched by humans or animals. I woke my friend up again and to show her what was out front.  She looked out the window and asked me, \"What the hell happened last night?\" I know this was a long story, but I had to go back and correct some things.  I just couldn‚Äôt keep all of this information out of this crazy experience.  I swear that I am not making this up and have witnesses to substantiate this weird night/morning.  My friend has agreed to talk to anyone about her piece of the story too.  However, we do have to keep the kids out of it for obvious reasons.  However, my friend‚Äôs children and I have experienced other UFO‚Äôs that same year, at that same house.  And there is more to tell, believe me!  But that was the most amazing UFO at that house because it was so huge.  But we do have more stories about some other cool sighting too of a smaller triangle flying 20ft above our heads 3x‚Äôs in the same night.  But that‚Äôs another story for another time.  Besides, I don‚Äôt remember the date of that one.",

   "text":"A seemingly cloaked or disguised craft 4/23/07 Elmore, Alabama   Dear Sir, I am a Correctional Officer with the Alabama Department of Corrections and work at one of the prisons in Elmore County, Alabama.   This morning several other officers and myself observed an odd phenomenon.  What we saw appeared to us to be some sort of cloud which upon closer examination appeared to be some sort of flying craft hidden or, to use a term from Star Trek, \"cloaked,\" so as to be unseen. Before we are laughed off as nuts, let me explain the whole story as it happened:   It was around 8:00 AM and was the morning count time and I was a dorm officer.  My dorm partner and myself counted \"A\" side of the dorm. Then as she went through the \"cube\" in the middle of the dorm to go through to the other side I went outside to go along the sidewalk to the other side to count. As I was walking along I felt a sudden blast of wind or breeze and felt sand stinging my face. I thought; What in the world? It is a nice day, where did that come from?  I looked in the direction of \"B\" Dorm and saw a low wall of dust coming towards me as if propelled by some unseen force and when it hit me I had to shield my face and eyes.  It was not really a high wind, but just propelled along by some force other than high wind if that makes any sense and when it hit me it felt very cold or extremely cool. I looked up to check the sky wondering if some storm was blowing in out of nowhere. But to my amazement the sky was mostly clear, but something immediately caught my eye when I looked up.  A dark sort of a dirty grey cloud tinged in pink was going over at a good clip.   But what struck me as odd was not only the fact that it was close to the ground, maybe a couple of hundred yards, but that it was going along at a fast pace, much faster than a normal cloud, even in a storm, but also that it was shaped so funny.  I wondered about such a strange looking, lonely storm cloud to be skipping across the country side at such a good speed all by itself in an otherwise clear sky?!?   As I stood and stared at it for a moment as it flew along over the \"camp\" (slang name for a prison) it I noticed a group of officers, \"Yard Rovers,\" standing in the prison yard a hundred yards away watching it intently also. I then turned and went on into the dorm to continue our count. But others watched it until it was out of site (see below). But it was shaped so funny that it stuck in my mind for the next few hours and sort of worried me like something nagging at the back of your mind. It was as I said a dirty, very dark grey like a storm cloud and had a pinkish tint in places, especially along the underside. It was not shaped like any cloud that I have ever seen. It was almost like a big wedge the size of two or three houses end to end, the pointed or narrow end to the front, the aft end sort of flat or squared. And above this aft end was a section of it, of \"cloud \",  that was sort of like a diamond or triangular shape, almost reminding one of the tail section of a rocket or plane. All along it and especially the aft end of it were sort of like tendrils hanging along being tugged at by the air as it went along, as if the vapors were being sucked off by the passing air or wind and being constantly rejuvenated.  Sort of like, if one can imagine it, a block of dry ice flying along with its vapors enfolding around it and flitting around and from it with the wind.  That stuck in the back of my mind about how it looked to me. Then a bit later a single word came to me, \"artificial!\"  That was what I was trying to think of , what was nagging at me!  It had almost an artificial look to it!!  Maybe I have been a \"Trekky\" too many years, studying space travel, reading up on and being a fan of things like \"Star Wars\" and \"Star Trek.\"   But the terminology on Star Trek used for the technology for a space ship to able to hide from radar and from visionary detection, basically being able to become invisible at will, is called a \"Cloaking Device!\"  Something similar is what the United States was trying to perfect with the \"Philadelphia Experiment\" during WWII. That experiment failed as far as I know and cost the military some lives. But not wanting to be laughed at I kept all these thoughts, uneasy feelings, and observations to my self for fear of being ridiculed. But as it turns out I was not the only one who had witnessed it!   Later, as the day was winding down, and I having forgotten it,  three of the yard rovers stopped in our dorm on their rounds and sat down to take a slight pause, or break, to rest their feet and began going on about something..  It dawned on me that they were chattering about the same thing I had seen!  But they had more to tell;  One commented on the coldness that hit them, and how without any real high wind a wall of slight debris and sand came at them also, sort of along of and in front of this so called \"cloud.\"  They agreed that it was sort of like the \"fore blast\" in front of a helicopter or hover craft of some sort, but not as violently thrown as a helicopter does.  Someone else asked if anyone else noticed the orange plastic barrier to the construction area sort of just wrinkle up and roll up and over into a ditch, but with no real high wind to make it do so, just that sort of uncanny cold air and slight breeze that went along in front of the \"cloud.\" One officer was asking did the rest of us notice how the so called cloud, or cloudlike substance around it,  kept folding in on itself, sort of like renewing itself or something.  Another officer said that she thought from the beginning that it was some sort of secret, or even alien, craft in some sort of disguise and that when it went on over them she intently tried to look at the back of it to see if there was the \"back\" or aft end of some sort of craft visible.  She said that the cloud, or vapors, just boiled down and over the back of it hiding the rear end, with the same tendrils of vapor or cloud that I had seen trailing behind it.   And then they all agreed very excitedly that when it went over and across the open area of the prison that the \"fore blast\" of breezy dust and all preceded it and when it crossed over a tree line of tall trees the tops of those trees went crazy jiggling and swaying very fast back and forth, and as soon as it passed this movement ceased.     That last bit of info sort of puts me in mind of the reports that at so called UFO landing sites it has been found that the molecular structure of plant material in the area had been changed or altered!   One of the rovers said that he had been going to the Back-Gate at the time to let in the \"Farm Squad\" inmates. He chimed in and said that he had seen the same thing and now that he thought of it he agreed with all that they said. And he said that when he let the farm squad inmates in the Farm Boss asked him did he see that odd looking cloud flying fast across the camp?  This Farm Boss more or less saw and felt the same things too.  Of course by then I had chimed in with what I saw, my observations, and my feelings.   One of the officers, who is very interested in science, space travel, etc, as I am asked,\"Officer Edelen, did you get the definite feeling that it was a craft of some kind, somehow \"Cloaked\" or in some kind of disguise?  I readily agreed and we all more or less agreed that whether it was an alien UFO of some sort of a top secret craft of the United States, it gave us all the impression that it was a craft of some sort in some sort of disguise.  I of course even commented that I had read reports of alien craft that were not of solid material atoll but were known as some sort of plasma craft, possibly craft capable of traveling inter-dimensionally.   It does indeed appear to have been just that; some sort of artificial anomaly, or some sort of craft: One;  it was flying too fast,  Two;  it kept a set course until out of site,  and Three; it retained it shape until it was out of site.  And Four; one officer commented that she had studied its shadow for a moment.  She said the shape she had seen was not the obscured shape of an edgeless or uneven edged cloud but the definite shape of a hard craft of some sort.   And then they all agreed that they had seen  three Air Force jets, one behind the other, flying way up above the \"cloud\" but along the exact same course as if they were following it, hunting it, or possibly monitoring it.  At that time we called Channel 12 news and asked if anyone had reported seeing anything strange in the skies over Elmore, Autauga counties. The guy I spoke to said that at that time they had received no such reports.    Now these officers that saw this: I have right at14 years in with the Alabama Department of Corrections, and the others on up to near 20 yrs and over.  They all three are mature men and women and very serious, professional Correctional Officers, not given to flights of fancy and delusion and are trained both by not only APOST Certified Correctional Training but also by the training and intuition that years of service gives you to spot anything unusual and out of the ordinary and keep a level head while doing so, and to be able to mentally keep notes while doing so. And to top it all off this evening a 2nd shift supervisor called me at my home asking about the \"sighting,\" that some of our 1st shift officers that were working overtime on his shift had commented on seeing what we saw along with several inmates. I told him what we saw and he concurred saying that is what others there had told him. So I am tendering this report in the hopes that perhaps someone might find it interesting, might even already know about it, or to see if others have reported any thing similar.. Sincerely yours,   Elmore.,  Al.",

   "text":"Bright  blue/white light and lost time. I am writing of this encounter just to document it. I cant give exact dates or even the year as a fact. I do recall the event very clearly, but it is something that my family and I have never spoken of.  Well, a couple of years ago I did ask my mother some things about that night, but she has no memory of it. There is really not a lot to tell about the actual sighting but I will do my best to explain my encounter. I will also mention facts I do remember to help substantiate my gaps in memory. It was about 6:30 pm when my family and I were going into Quincy,Il. We were coming from Fowler, N.E. of Quincy. We drove west down U.S. 24 to Neikamps corner where we turned South. We traveled south to Ellington Road where we turned and headed west again. We traveled about 200 feet west when the encounter began. We were going into Quincy to go to church, we were going to a revival meeting. This being said, helps me to establish the time and approximate date.  The revival meetings  started at 7:00pm and the location of the encounter is about a 15 minute drive to the church. We were always early to the meetings as my dad was an usher and had duties before services would begin. This also helps me get a rough idea  of the year. I actively attended church with my family from about 1968 to 1972. I want to say the encounter was in 1970 but I can't jog my memory enough to state that as a fact.I do know we were riding in a  white 1964 Chevy station wagon. Since my father has died no one remembers when we owned that car. We were heading west, just in front of the WGEM radio towers.  I was setting behind the driver looking south out the window.  The sky began to become very bright.  It was very dark out at 6:30 in the evening so it must have been late fall.   As the sky brightened I became very afraid, I thought it was the end of the world.  I remember looking to the sky to see something but there was nothing to see.  I then turned and looked north towards the radio tower and saw the brightest blue white light I have ever seen in my life. The next thing I can remember we were headed south on Columbus road, just coming up to the KHQA radio tower. No one said a word about anything, we just kept going towards Quincy.  We arrived at 16th and Locust in Quincy, without ever talking about the light.  Everything looked normal at church when we arrived.  I could see the people shaking hands and greeting each other as they always do.  We got out of the car and went in and began to socialise as usual when we found out we were late. The services were over and everyone was going home. This would make the time be around 9:30 or 10:00, services always lasted that long, or even later. We talked for a bit and then returned home. We missed the whole church service, went back home and never said one word to one another about it. I have often wondered over the past 38 years or so what happened. Roughly 3 hours of time are gone and not one of us has said anything about it.  I have mentioned it to friends and family a few times, but I have never offered an explanation. I have no idea what happened in the 3 hours but I do know I takes less than 5 minutes to drive from the WGEM towers to the KHQA tower. These towers may be gone now I haven't lived in Illinois for about 20 years now.",

   "text":"Dayton, Ohio sighting The date of this sighting is approximate. It occurred late spring early summer when I was about 10 years old in Dayton, Ohio. We lived 2 houses West of Our Lady Of Mercy church. It was after dark and the family was watching TV in the dining room. I looked east out the side porch window and saw the craft. It was oval from what I could tell, with yellow light comming from what looked to be windows around the center of the craft. The craft was at 50'to 70' altitude judging from the tree height over which it was moving.The craft was at a distance of 150' to 200' from our house. I yelled for my family and they moved to the windows and saw the craft too. We then ran upstairs to get a better view of the craft. It moved slowly taking perhaps 20-30 seconds to move out of sight over the woods that bordered church property. While we were watching the craft a figure was seen inside who looked to be working controls of some sort. The figure was backlighted by the glow and I only was able to make out a dark human type shape. The following morning my brother and I went back in the woods where the craft had dissappered. About 200' inside the woods there was an area of crushed brush and even a couple broken saplings the largest being about 2&1/2 inches in diameter. This area was about 50' around, circular. And about 20'to 25' apart in the center there were 4 holes. These holes were about 3\" wide and 6\" to 8\" deep. For several years following this sighting very little grew in the crushed area, and what plants that did grow there were sickly as was a tree that was on the edge of the area. No sound was ever heard from the craft, and though the outline was rather vague due to the darkness, There was no sign or visible means of propultion, and a absence of any engine sound.

River in Oregon, somewhere remote North of Medford, Oregon (we resided in Ashland, Oregon, at the time)...compelled by others willing to share their experience in this matter I am documenting this extraordinary event with ‚ÄòMy Dog as my witness‚Äô!   The setting was close to 1:00am on a balmy night with a severe-clear sky (although very little moonlight) for an overnight fishing/camping trip in the Summer of 1971 at a Hydro Electrical Station with a huge floodlight on the small buildings‚Äô roof, aside a concrete canal (with night fishing allowed with a permit only) off the Rouge River in Oregon somewhere remote North of Medford, Oregon, (we resided in Ashland, Oregon, at the time)...our permit allowed us to park on the gravel covered levy at the edge of the canal near the floodlight 20‚Äô away (very slow flowing, calm/silent water except for the occasional fish jumping). Myself 18 years old, and husband 21 (leaving nameless to protect his identity, per his request) with our highly trained 2 years old pure black, fearless German Shepard dog, named ((dog's name deleted)), (he even survived a rattlesnake-bite on his nose without a whimper).  Our 1960 Mint Green F100 Ford pickup truck with overhead camper was backed up to roughly 20 feet from the concrete-canal, set-up with camp chairs, lantern, snacks and fishing gear set out, and already catching catfish with 2 hooks on each line‚Ä¶.although there was very little Moonlight, the area was very bright due to the huge security floodlight-beam attached to the roof of the small Hydro Electric station (10‚Äôx10‚Äô building about 20‚Äô away) shinning to the opposite side of the canal where the other side of the shore was visible, I‚Äôm guessing to be 50 feet off in the distance?  ((name deleted)), (the dog) was napping near me, sitting in the camp-chair 5‚Äô from the waters-edge tending my fishing-pole ...all of a sudden ((dog's name deleted)) bolted to all four feet and started the strangest sound I ever heard from any dog then or to this day!...guttural-howl/growl-scream, as if the dog might be in severe pain, attempted to crawl under my camp-chair where obviously he cannot fit, then trying to cover his ears with his paws as if trying to block some ear piercing whatever?...after that, he was scraping his head on both side of his ears along the sharp-gravel in obvious horrific pain when we heard/noticed the water in the canal was lapping the shores vigorously and rippling in concentric circles from the center of the canal, so thought maybe a Moose or some very large animal jumped into the water but we would have heard-it if that happened?  .soon we realize we can see the opposite side of the canal clearly and no Moose or animal in sight...including we see that the concentric circles are full round circles so whatever it was the circles started in the middle of the canal not at the levy edge and the ripples/waves are getting stronger, similar to what a helicopter hovering overhead would cause?...except, it is completely silent and no dust or gravel blowing around, all-the-while the dog is continuing to suffer, at that moment we both look-up to see a huge pulsing-glow-fire-orange/red oval (football) shaped craft above-us with no apparent windows, seamless-looking solid material/construction and no visible means of propulsion or con-trails? (guessing 50 yards in length by 10 yards in height) approximately hovering at the height of a 20 story building...nearly over the top of us we see that it appeared to be spinningiin-place at a supersonic rate (how can this not make noise is going thru my mind?)...we freeze in our tracks, our heads trying to justify/comprehend what we are seeing while the dog seems to be acting worse for pain and screaming even more?...we grabbed our gear and shot for the truck 5 feet away as we see the object bolt across the sky away from us in a blink becoming a barely visible-dot only a moment later to reappear above us again in the next blink of time!...how is this possible with no sound we humans can hear but maybe the dog can hear-it?...about 3-5 minutes have gone by now... Strangely, our dog ((dog's name deleted)) jumped in the camper-back with the gear as soon as the door was barely open, forcing his way inside using his head as a plow in a panic-fleeing-demeanor...I say strangely, as he never wants to ride in the back of the camper, only wanted to sit in the truck cab with us, so I figured he must be as afraid as we are?!?  Fleeing, as we are freaked-out and shaking in the fright-flight-mode (full-on heart-pounding fear) with dust and gravel spewing from the truck-tires as we swerve out of there as-fast-as-possible and are soon out of eyesight of the craft due to the dense forest of Pines, Oaks, Buckeyes, Sequoias and Redwoods blocking the view. It took another several minutes before the dog recovered from his painful event and finally stopped panting...as we drove along in silence trying in our minds to make sense of what just happened?...my ex-husband blurts out in a scary-threatening-tone, and commanded that ‚ÄúI better not repeat this to anybody as he would deny it and call me crazy‚Äù...and actually ‚Äòwith my dog as my witness‚Äô, he was more compelling evidence/witness of something strange in our midst than the opinion of my ex-husband. Approximately a month later, while reading a book from my co-workers: Book Club in Medford, Oregon, titled: Chariots of the Gods by Erich von Daniken, and I assumed it would be similar to the Kon Tikki story?...quickly I realize it is a book of UFO sightings and read a page where there was a similar experience of water rippling in concentric circles with no sound or apparent rotary blades in site?...I felt a huge shock-knock of a flash-back to our sighting like it just had-happened and thought it could really be true what we witnessed that strangest of nights could possibly be from another world?!?...hmm? ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness and she seemed to us to be sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a reliable witness.  PD))",

I was traveling in the family station wagon with my mother and 12 year old sister. We were headed home from shopping traveling south on south ave in the small town of Glenolden pa. as we approached the area of the Macdade Mall we could see the traffic was stopped up a head. Then we noticed that people were out of their cars looking up at the sky.As we looked up there was a giant craft of some kind, I mean this thing was huge as big as the mall and the parking lot all put together. There were a few white lights on the center of the under side and the craft made no sound at all. It just seemed to hoover there in the sky.The craft was an oval shape brownist gray in color. there many witnesses to this event. We watched it for about five minutes then continued home. After arriving we called our local radio station to report what we had saw, they were receiving many reports of the same object in the sky.That night it was all over the local news. And by the next day it seemed, it was completley forgotten about and never mentioned again, there was no explanation ever given for what we saw in the sky that night. to this day my sister and wonder what it was that we saw.

   "text":"A massive silent object was a small dot in a matter of seconds leaving us watching in total darkness and amazement. Since this sighting I've not really had a venue to give my story, until I happened upon the Chicago story. So here goes.  I was a high school senior with my boyfriend and another couple driving out one summer night to my boyfriend's family farm.  As we approached a hill near the farm I noticed a very bright light ahead of us up the hill slowing moving across the road.  It was so bright and unusual that we pulled over, stopped the engine and watched.  Scary as it might seem now, we were just in awe of what it might be.   In what seemed like eternity the object made its way across the road almost directly in front of us just above the tree tops with no sound at all coming from it.  By this time the object, which my memory now thinks of as a fat (in height) oval, was not as bright.  We had also at some point gotten out of the car just staring at it, not believing what we were seeing.  And there were maybe 3 or 4 other cars that had stopped and parked as well on both sides of the road watching the same event, but I don't recall talking to any of them. I don't know how long we stood there, but the thing I remember most is that the object made absolutely no sound and just hovered there with some kind of colored and white lights revolving on the top very slowly.  I felt then and still do now that whatever it was, it knew we were there.  Then the object started very slightly backing up away from us.  Just a moment later it backed away much faster then stopped again.  Before we could blink it was gone!  A massive object was a small dot in a matter of seconds!  Gone.  What is amazing to think of today is that everyone watching that night just got back in their vehicles and left without a word!

   "text":"Three sightings in 13 years. I actually have 3 sightings: The first was when I was stationed at Ft. Huachuca, AZ, in July, 1973. My friend, Ed Knees and I were going northbound toward Huachuca City (where we both lived off base), at approximately 22:30 hours, when I noticed a golden light pacing us. I mentioned this to Ed, who said it was probably the moon reflecting on electrical or telephone wires. After I pointed out that the wires were on his side, he stopped the van. We both observed the light, which was stationary at this time, until Ed used the spotlight mounted to the top of his van (used for hunting at night). Right after Ed flashed the light at the ‚Äúufo‚Äù, it completely vanished. The really unusual thing was, it made absolutely NO sound whatsoever. This base also had rotary and fixed wing aircraft, and I am very familiar with the current US governmental inventory. This occurrence took approximately 10 minutes.  Second sighting: July, 1985 - I was sitting in a hot tub with 2 other friends, at approximately 21:00 hours, when we all noticed a oval craft, going over our heads. This craft had green, blue and white lights going in a counter-clockwise circle, around the craft. We were just 2 miles from the Concord Naval Weapons Station (carried nukes) in a town called Antioch, California, and the craft made absolutely NO noise -‚Äìnot even a whisper. Again, I am familiar with most fixed wing and rotor aircraft, and this did not fit that inventory! This incident took approximately 5 minutes.  Third sighting: August, 1985, same location (Antioch, California).  At approximately 02:00 hours, I got up from watching the TV, to get a drink at the kitchen sink. I happened to look up to see a very large, dark gray triangular object apparently floating in the air, approximately 5000 feet altitude. It had red glowing lights on each point, and a softly glowing white light in the center. This craft also made no noise at all. After 2 or 3 minutes, it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.

She drew a picture of the sighting and ask me to make a painting of it. I did an air brush painting but she pasted \"stars\" on the oval objects.  This vision stayed on her mind until she died at the age of 85.   I have no proof except her word, notes and my drawing but I was wondering if anyone else ever saw a formation like this?",

   "text":"Translucent arch over road, small cloud that changed colors and sparkled. This sighting happened in the summer of 1974 a few miles south of Minot ND.  I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  It was a very clear night and I walked down the driveway from the house  so I could get a full view of the night sky. When I came to the end of the driveway I noticed a white translucent arch over the dirt road  that ran in front of the house north and south.  I was puzzled by this and wondered if it was some kind of fog.  I walked  about 30 feet down the road to get a better look.  I could see that the arch went from one side of the road to the other side right down to the ditch.  I walked under it and looked up and could faintly see the stars through the arch while looking strait up into the sky.  I then would walk about three feet from under it and the stars where all bright and all the sky clear.  It reminded me of the milky way.  I moved under it then  next to it a couple more times  then excited I ran to the house to get someone else to come see this. It was about 10 pm as my parents where watching the news so I went to my brothers room who is 15 years old.  He thought I was crazy but I persuaded him to come out and look about 10 minutes later as he was in bed  watching TV and had to dress.  When we got to the area where I had seen the arch it was gone.  Down the road north about 60 Ft., we both witnessed a cloud above the road about 20 feet in diameter.  We started to follow it as it was moving away from us.  It was no longer a translucent white. It would turn red to blue, green and had like sparkling little lights shimmering in it. We both started to follow it till the road ended 200 ft. then it veered to the NW and we crossed over the barbwire fence climbing over a couple hills to follow it.  We stayed down when we came to the top of a hill as it almost seamed to be trying to lose us.  It stopped over the top of a large watering hole about 30 feet..  We could not follow it anymore but as we watched it for about one minute it was still changing colors and sparkling.  It then started to fade quickly.  We walked home amazed as we lived in the country, hunt, hike at night to a neighbors.  We never seen anything like it.  To this day we recalled this sighting and both seen this.  We had seen the same thing other than him not seeing the arch. I was not a drug user or drinker.  I am now 48 years old and still can picture this dense cloud type object that changed colors along with the arch over the road. We have never seen anything like this again, nor have met anyone else that seen anything like this before.  We figured it could have been something from the Minot Air Base.  We have seen fog over water and such.  The arch did not loose its shape fade.  I was thinking of walking down into the ditch to one side of the arch touching to the ground to see if I could walk through it or put my hand in it.  I decided that may be dangerous so ran back to get a witness. I would like to be contacted about sightings in the Fargo area.  When I googled to see if anyone else seen thease sightings your sight popped up with reports on the same date and same thing that still hangs around at times.  I would like to know how to report the observation properly or hear a explanation.

   "text":"Multi- event, three orb / stars move in triangle unison, cigar shaped craft turns up to sky becomes point of light My friend and I set up on a dock on Lake Sebring to watch the stars. We were laying on camping cots so we were focused on the same spot in the sky.  Looking about 15 degrees from directly overhead, facing west, over the lake.  I now know this shape to be the torso of pegasus. This was a multi-faceted event. First we saw a couple typical satellites pin-points moving in a straight line. (My thoughts, satellites)  Next we noticed heat lightning, but later both recognized it was more like subtle bands of white moving across the ecliptic east-west and became semi-regular.  15 to 20 minutes would pass.  Three stars began to move in perfect unison shape of a triangle ‚Äì after 1-2 sec. the bottom most star got 3-5 times brighter before shrinking back to its original size, all the while keeping the shape of the triangle.  This group moved out of view. Next,the most perfect shooting star i have ever seen, traveling a distance i had not seen. Two rails of Gold sparkle streamers followed behind it. Next, faint lights appeared in the torso, tens at a times, all moving in random, like koi fish in a pond coming to the surface to eat. Then it got good. The sky seemed to turn blue-dark almost flourescent. All but one star faded out and it began to oscillate. I became extremely emotional ‚Äì i could feel ‚Äì not sure if i was being \"told\" ‚Äì but i told my friend,\"they are going to give us the show we wanted to see\". At that point, smaller white stars began to shoot about 1-2 degrees away from the oscillating star and loop back.  I started telling my friend \"it's like they are telling me i can go with them\", but i wasn't hearing voices. It was a feeling. I told my friend that they understood that he had a family and could not come.  I became very scared. I know in my head, there was a break away from this type of communication.  The star seemd to rise higher in the sky and i wept more.  My friend tried to comfort me telling me to take it in.  It was now the most beautiful feeling i had ever felt.  The sky began to \"woosh\" colors of what seemed like thick liquid clouds.  Purple, blue, black, gold, silver were swooshing at incredible speed. At one point it became calm again (though there was no noise associated with this even). We are laying there on our cots. I dont think there was a presence, but i was terrified to look around. First for fear that I would end the event, but i didnt think i could handle seeing an extra terrestrial. During this calm, i felt a blue glow coming from behind us, almost like what was making the sky this strange color. I remembered seeing this blue glow on my nose as i continued looking out over the lake. I told my friend \" i dont think we are on earth anymore\". Almost like that seen from contact when Jodi Foster meets the dad-form of the being. The sky picked back up, i wept more at the beauty. Then it stopped again. The sky went black, the stars came back‚Ä¶but the sun was also coming up now and within minutes we are in dusk. We both stood up and jumped for joy knowing we had seen a unique event. Looking out over the dock, we saw a plane but quickly realized no. It was a small cigar shaped craft, too far to make out detail. But obvious it had no wings and no tail and was such a shined piece of metal that it was almost white. It was at least a mile away laterally and a couple thousand feet up. It glided, silently toward our position but latterly away, like a fly by‚Ä¶.we both got that \"hello, goodbye\" feeling. It made its right turn parallel to our position and kept going up until it was a star and then vanished. Afterward, trey and i both noticed a sort of electricity left the air. I made note of black floaters in my eye, so big that it was like news print letters ‚Äì like globs of oil. He said he had the same thing. We sat down for a minute and knew the event was over. During this even i never told my friend what i saw. I only asked him what he saw. He was always able to describe precisely what i saw. We are both educators ‚Äì so obviously , its not my first way to help my career to talk about UFO's.

   "text":"A short accounting of this even written for a memoirs class. UFO Sightings The sky was black‚Äîone of those moonless nights with crisp air and unending visibility.  If memory serves me it was early in the winter of 1974. I had just concluded a late-evening insurance appointment on Grantland Avenue west of highway 99 in Fresno, CA. Between 9:30 and 10:00 o‚Äôclock, I headed for my home in Rolling Hills on the Madera County side of the San Joaquin River.  The most direct route from Grantland Avenue was to take Herndon Avenue east to Blackstone and then north on Highway 41 to Avenue 10. A mile or so west of the Sierra Sky Park I noticed what looked like an airplane, roughly 500 feet above the ground preparing to land at the tiny airstrip.  Small planes landing here were not uncommon so I paid little attention to it.  But I did notice that its rate of descent was considerably slower than an airplane.  Maybe it‚Äôs traveling toward me, I reasoned.  The closer I got to the airport the more attention I paid to the object‚Äôs flight pattern. After seeing how slowly it was moving I ruled out the possibility of it being an airplane, and thought it was a glider.  The only other logical possibilities were a hot-air balloon or a helicopter. When I clearly saw its oblong shape I ruled out these possibilities too. Curious, I pulled off the road onto the soft shoulder, came to a stop, and turned my engine off. I got out of the car and listened carefully for any audible sound. Nothing. Not a whir, not a click, not a sound! The windowless gray object wasn‚Äôt hovering. Instead it slowly drifted in a northwesterly direction across Herndon Avenue toward the airstrip about a hundred feet above my head, still continuing its descent. I felt sure it would land but instead it drifted west and began following Herndon Avenue back toward highway 99. I got back in my car, turned around, and followed its white light. As I picked up speed it picked up speed. The faster I accelerated the faster it went. Then in the blink of an eye it pulled away from me, its intense white taillight receding into the black starry night. What was that? I thought. The traffic on Herndon that night was non-existent. In 1974, Herndon Avenue was little more than a two-lane country road. I‚Äôm calling the airport when I get home. Maybe they‚Äôll have some information. Someone surely saw that. Once home I called the Fresno Air Terminal control tower directly, which you could do in the early 70s. ‚ÄúHas anything odd shown up on your radar screen the past thirty minutes?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo sir,‚Äù the air traffic controller answered. ‚ÄúWhy, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow could you have missed it?‚Äù ‚ÄúMissed what?‚Äù After explaining my encounter he said, ‚ÄúWell, for one thing it would depend on its altitude and location relative to our radar equipment,‚Äù and then continued with some additional mumbo-jumbo about how radar works. As I slowly calmed down from my excitement I explained to him in detail what I had seen. ‚ÄúYou know, that‚Äôs really odd. Someone else called me from near the Sanger River bottom earlier tonight relating almost exactly what you‚Äôve described.‚Äù And the following week I was northbound on highway 41 south of the San Joaquin River Bridge, when I noticed a bright-white light in the sky similar to the one I‚Äôd seen earlier. I felt sure it was an airplane and continued observing it as I crossed the bridge. As soon as the object reached Avenue 10 it took a laser-like ninety-degree turn to the left and accelerated out of sight at an unbelievable speed. Many people have experienced sightings of UFOs. Many scientists and the military downplay their existence because nine out of ten sightings can be explained by other phenomena. Some people claim they were abducted, with a small percentage of these asserting that medical experiments and who knows what else were performed on them. Since that time I have listened to stories and accounts of UFOs with interest on one hand, and with reservation on the other. Most of these sightings involve objects shaped like discs or triangularpatterned groups of objects. Nearly all first-hand accounts have not described what I saw‚Äîan oblong-shaped craft. With the advent of the Internet I have revisited the subject hoping to find photos or stories that more closely mirrored my experiences. My search uncovered only one sighting that described something similar to what I saw. This incident happened near Mansfield, Ohio, on October 18, 1973, and was widely recognized as one of the most notable UFO sightings that year. I was amazed to find how many similarities my encounters shared with this documented UFO sighting. Here are a few samples: ‚ÄúCigar-shaped metallic object with dome, body lights, light beam, apparent lifting force‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúhovering relationship‚Äù ‚ÄúThe object appeared solid‚Ä¶red light at the nose, a white light at the tail‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúNo turbulence was felt and‚Ä¶heard no sound‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶the object accelerated and moved off to the west, showing only the white ‚Äútail‚Äù light as it receded, and made a distinct 45 degree course change to the right, heading toward Lake Erie.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn the ground, the driver and passengers of a car saw two lights, one red and one green‚Ä¶ At first they thought it was a small plane flying low‚Ä¶heard no sound‚Ä¶its unusual qualities caused the driver to pull over and stop.‚Äù There is no doubt that what I saw was real. It was just out of my realm of understanding. I haven‚Äôt witnessed another sighting since, but will continue to search the skies for unusual events ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"A cigar-shaped craft about 100-200 feet, hovering, yellowish-orange with red and white lights.  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I am quite certain it was on a Tuesday night between 8 and 9pm that I (age 11) and the rest of my family (mom, age 36; brother, age 12; brother, age 17) saw the craft. The popular TV show MASH was on in our living room which faced Colorado Blvd, the street where we lived. My mother and two brothers were in the living room watching MASH, and I was in the family room watching another TV show. I could see and hear through our kitchen into our living room, where the rest of my family was watching television. I began to hear some excitement coming from the living room and went in to see what was going on. My whole family was staring out the window when suddenly my brother (17) darted to his room to get a camera and out the front door he went. I took his place at the window and was amazed at what I saw. Above the houses across the street and hovering, was a cigar-shaped disc, about 100-200 feet long, bright, with what I can remember as alternating white and red lights. Things began to happen very fast and the excitement was none like I‚Äôve experienced before. We all were outside within seconds of me entering the living room to see what was going on. Once outside, my brother (17) easily scaled onto our roof via our front porch. My other brother (12) ran out into the front yard. I can remember my mother being very concerned, she kept me by her side as we continued to watch from our front porch. My brother‚Äôs camera was a cheap Kodak with a flash, but in the dark, he was unlucky at getting any kind of exposure. Anyway, we watched the craft through the tall trees, hover back and forth, over the houses, for about two minutes. The trees were not in bloom as of yet (my estimated date of 4/1 very easily could have been late February or March) and I could see the object through the trees. Another aspect that I am certain of is that I could see through the craft, I mean, it was a clear starry night, facing Mt. Rose and Slide Mountain, part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains which are easily visible on a clear ! day. At night, however, all one could see were the stars, and I can remember seeing the stars through the outline of the craft, which was bright orange-yellow. The lights I mentioned earlier went from one end to the other, through the center of the cigar shape. The strangest thing about our sighting is that is seemed very dark and quiet on our street for that time of night. Not one of our neighbors, who we all knew very well, were outside at that time, and not a single vehicle drove by. The episode, as I said, lasted about two minutes. The last thing I remember is that it all of the sudden disappeared, either from speeding away, or vanishing into thin air, I can‚Äôt say which. I am confident the year was 1975 for a number of reasons which I won‚Äôt get into here for this could get very long. I will say that this sighting has never left my consciousness. I rarely tell anyone and very rarely discuss it with my family. I can also say that the experience immediately (within one year) turned me and my mother into UFO buffs, of a sort. I can remember reading my first UFO book (Project Blue Book) I checked out at my school library (Vaughn Middle School). Ever since we‚Äôve shared information and still do to this day, but we rarely venture into a conversation about that night. The experience has changed my life, and at the ripe age of almost forty-three, my interest has peaked so much that I have finally taken the time to write it down. That night we called the radio station and they thought we were joking. I told my friends at school and they didn‚Äôt believe my either. I do remember my mother telling us one of here friends from the hospital where she worked, spotted the craft. This person, according to my mom lived across Plumb Lane, so it made sense that she could have seen the same thing we did.

   "text":"It was the summer of 1975. I was 11 years old.  At the parental urging of my mother, she had insisted that I clean my room spotless that day, which I did, carefully organizing my clothes and closet, hanging my posters, sorting my books, etc.  I was proudly sitting on my newly made bed.It was very dark and still.  The windows to my right were wide open with creme eyelet light weight curtains.  I leaned against my headboard and was getting ready to turn on my light to read, I was not sleeping or under the blankets.  I had noticed how still it was, not even a cricket or frog noise.  We lived in a house on the lake and there was always noise. It was extremely quiet. I heard it first. A slight roaring sound, almost like a semi truck or helicopter whooshing sound. My curtains were suddenly standing straight out and the light was coming through, passing across my bed to fall on the opposite wall.  The wierd thing was that it was like it was passing through a grating or window blinds. long lines of light traveling up my wall, not down, as though something was ascending and turning its lights up into my window. The noise was almost deafening. The wind was messing up everything in my room I had just spent hours on, papers were flying, my posters were being blown/sucked from the wall, books flying, etc. I dont know how this next part came to be, but suddenly they were in my room. At that point all I could see were 4 small creatures. Now in my adulthood, I would describe them as the typical &quot;greys&quot; only they seemed to be a little heavier in weight. I could see one was rifling through my closet, clothes were being pulled from hangers and tossed aside, just like they were curious to see what was in there. Another stood over by my closed door, watching, and looking down at the foot of my bed there were 2 more, their hands resting on the end of the bed, not much taller than the edge of the bed, and they were just watching me with round black eyes. I remember trying to move, to scream but was unable to, doing nothing but turn my head a bit from side to side, up and down. I sensed something else next to me, above me. Turning my head up and to the left there was another creature. This one was different, more ant looking and taller, more brownish in color. I could see pupils in its eyes. It was standing over me menacingly, suddenly with a quick movement its face was right in mine, just inches from my face, its eyes looking at me as if to study what I was thinking. It brought a 3 fingered and 1 thumb hand up and lay it across my nose and partially my eyes. I dont know what happened after that. The next morning as I remembered what had happened, I found myself sitting on the side of my bed, still clothed from the nite before, bed unslept in. Looking around the room, it was a total mess, papers, books clothes, etc. everywhere. I ran out my bedroom door to find my mother. I asked my mother, &quot;Mom, did you see and hear that huge noise and lights last nite? I thought an airplane crashed or a semi was coming through the side of the house&quot;. I didnt want to get detailed about what I thought may have just happened to me I didnt want her to think I was making it up or crazy. She had heard nor seen nothing out of the ordinary. I told her that the wind was so big it made my curtains stand straight out and blew my room all over the place. She felt this was just an excuse and said I was making it up because I hadnt cleaned my room as she had told me to. But I had. I had cleaned it spotless. I never told her what really happened. A few days before this incident, I was looking into the night sky and saw what I cn only describe as dancing stars, tiny points of light looping and dancing around each other. Years later, approximately 1982. I had a 3rd experience. Something followed me part of the way home as I drove the back roads home. It kept beside me hovering above the big corn field along the side of the road appearing to be a glowing green oval shaped light about twice the size of the car. If I slowed it would go ahead a little bit and stop and wait for me to keep driving. As I neared the end of that road to turn onto another, it disappeared from my view.

   "text":"A blue, oval shaped craft with glowing panels through the center flying in odd patterns and hovering around the area. It was 1975 in Bourbonnais/Bradley IL. I was 10 years old and lived in Stadium Heights apartments when  someone had noticed a strange, blue, oval shaped craft with glowing panels of different shades of blue through the center flying in odd  patterns and then hovering around the area . This was broad daylight. Soon, a crowd formed and the police were called. They responded and just stood and watched  like everyone else. The ship would hover, fly quickly  towards us and then  turn and fly off in another direction just to stop and hover once more in a different position than when it started. At one point, an officer grew alarmed and ducked down behind his squad car door with his weapon drawn because the craft had turned in our direction and came closer than before. I had lived at the opposite end of the complex from where the crowd was gathered and walked back to our apartment to get a drink of water.  As I was returning , the ship flew over the area where I was walking and I got a close look at it.  It stunned me when it came down lower because it was so big that it looked as though it might crash into the nearest building.  It hovered a minute and then went back to the general area that we saw it in originally. After about 40 minutes or so it turned and flew off as quickly as it appeared. We were told by the local police that it was a new advertising machine for the bank.  Can you imagine that?  It flew, there were no wings and it had no words on it.  That was a totally impossible scenario.

I was about 10-11 years old playing in the front yard with some friends.  I don't rememebr how my attention was drawn to the sky, probably by someone else.   I looked up and observed a low flying craft approx. 1000-2000 feet up.  It was large but I only vaguely remember the outline being circular or oval in shape.  What drew my attention was a circular formation of lights underneath alternating colors.   I do not recall any other lights on the object.  Our house was just 5 miles north of Richards-Gebauer Airbase so seeing aircraft was common all times of day and night. This would have been about the time that the base was slated for closing but the military traffic continued well past from when I moved from the neighborhood several years later.   The object was moving roughly from the northwest to the south east.  I rememebr someone saying \"Looks like the UFOs are landing.\"  I totally freaked and went inside the house.   That was the last I saw and I never talked about it over the years.  I had convinced my self that it was something normal, possibly a blimp.  Just recently I contacted my brother and asked him if he remembered the event and asked about the detatils just so I coudl verify that I had not missed soemthing after I went inside.  He related that he did remember, he would have been about 12-14 at the time.  He remembered the object as silvery with lights on the bottom but no other lights.   It was low and he and other(s) (Unknown who the other kids were) went in the backyard as it went over the house.   He remembers the object turning to the North and he watched it until it was out of sight.  He distinctly remembers thinking that the object definitely was not an aircraft.   pointed out the possibility of a blimp and we both agreed that that we had never seen a blimp in the area before (Especially due to the presence of the airbase) and we were very familiar with the aircraft that frequented the base since we alsways tried to identify the aircraft by the sound they made as they approached for a landing. This object made no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"In Valencia, Ca. the craft I was watching, was watching me. What is now known as the Santa Clarita Valley use to have a lot of farm land and rolling hills covered in Oaks in 1975. I am not sure about the exact date; but in the housing tract known as Old Orchard One, in Valencia, California, I had been waiting up for my Mother to come home from a late night Bible Study Group. I fell asleep on our exceptionally large sofa. I woke up sometime around 10pm; my Mother had covered me with a comfy blanket and was asleep on the other end of the sofa. I got up from the sofa and went down the hall to the bathroom. I then walked to the kitchen getting myself a glass of water from the sink. Instead of going to my room, I went back to the living room, pulled the covers over me, and curled up on the sofa; I glanced out our large dinning room windows, noticed the street light, and turned towards the wall. Eyes wide open; I remembered cleaning leaves from the neighbor‚Äôs lawn, and tidying up the garage that summer for spending cash. \"There was no street light there.?!\" I rolled over and saw a large oval shaped, what looked liked a silver metal color, craft. It had head lights, like those on a big rig, I could see detail, and the lights appeared to be spaced, going all the way around the outer rim of the craft. The lights changed colors; blue, red, green, white. It made no sound that I could hear. It sat about three feet above the neighbor‚Äôs roof, and covered the entire roof. The neighbor is aprox. one home over and across a street. I thought to myself, ‚Äúno one is going to believe this.‚Äù I even questioned in my mind, would people even believe my Mother. I knew, my Father being of a logical nature, people would be more likely to believe him. My instinct was to wake my Father, but he was in the back bedroom, down the hall. I slowly moved the covers down and slowly sat up, the craft moved up in the air slightly, so I slowly laid back down, the craft coming  down to its original position. I sat there a moment, starring at the craft and wondering, I repeated the same action, again the craft followed by movements moving upward and returning as I laid back down. Okay, I thought, the craft appears to be mimicking my movement; ‚Äúthis thing is watching me.‚Äù I kept watching the craft and thinking what to do, I did not want to be the only witness. I slowly sat up a third time and again, simultaneously, the craft moved up higher into the air, so I laid back down, the craft returning to a hovering position over the roof. I decided to wake my Mother gently; I kicked her foot several times with mine, until she stirred. My Mother, now slightly awake, responded. I asked her in a whisper, \"Mom don't move, just listen. Are your awake?\" My Mother replied, \"Yes.\" I told my Mother to very slowly roll over and look out the dining room window, but not to make any sudden movements. Well, she rolled over slowly just fine, the scream that followed and the jumping up and running towards the dinning room window wasn't part of the plan. The craft went straight up into the air, dimmed, went bright, then, I know this sounds strange, but the craft made itself look like a star. Dad came running but didn't understand why our knees were shaking looking at a star. We called the Sheriff and tried to explain, but it sounded so strange, we just decided to hang up. We watched what looked like a star move with the rest of the stars until dawn. Several nights thereafter, at around 10pm, in the sky, in the same general area, a light would come in dim at first, go extremely brig! ht, and then appear to be just another star. We decided to keep the curtains closed after that. The morning after the incident, I stood in our yard, and looked at the spot where the craft had been and said out loud, \"tell my baby I Love them.\"  I have no explanation why I said that.  Now, I am not a UFO hunter, never will be, don't want people bothering me, but for the record, so others know, our children had ‚Äúclose encounters.‚Äù We don‚Äôt discuss the matter much, we just know these incidents did happen. We live our life with all the joy God gave us, and realize what can you do? You can‚Äôt change it, you can‚Äôt really talk about it, and you don‚Äôt want anyone to know, so ‚Äúit‚Äù just happened,  and we‚Äôre okay, we don‚Äôt live in fear and still enjoy looking at a beautiful night sky.

They were the same bright, yellowish-white color as an ordinary light bulb filament. As they silently flew on a straight, SW path across the sky, they stayed in a tight group, while smoothly and continuously shifting positions in relation to each other. Their speed and altitude appeared to be very similar to that of an average commercial jet at cruising altitude.

It was complertely silent and rose no dust or dirt while hovering in our backyard. We took a picture of it because it would float by each night at the same time -when I took the picture and the flash went off -four large red lights flashed on at the bottom of the craft blinking in this order first, third, second, fourth  The object was quite large and as it went over our building I noticed that the bottom of the ship was a huge conglomeration of microchip configurations-there was no empty space except the space occupied by the lights. It appeared to have a mesh or screen like covering over the bottom-this had to have some sort of feet to land, there is no other way.

   "text":"It was a clear starry night when i looked up and saw an oval shaped object with lights,hovering with no sound. On a beautiful summer's night in the mid 1970's, the sky was clear and you could see all the stars. This was in the countryside, very dark, with a great view of the sky.  I was at my brother-in-law's house helping him work on his drag-racing car. I left about 11:00 P.M. My home was about 150 yards from his. I got about halfway across his yard,almost in mine and I stopped to relieve myself. It was so pretty out, I was looking around while I was doing my business.   I turned my head to the right and saw something I'll never forget.  It was hovering about 100 feet off the ground, not making a sound. It was oval  shaped and had lights that were all the way across it.  They were not going off and on but dimming and brightening. I stood there for about 15 seconds and thought about my brother-in-law. I called him and he came out wanting to know what was wrong and I told him to look and he couldn't believe it.  He said, \"What is that\"?  We stood there probably 30 sec. or more looking at it and all of a sudden it went straight up at a speed of nothing like on this planet, to an altitude to where it was about the size of my fingernail.  The object didn't make a sound and it stopped dead still and sat there about 5 sec. and made a 90 degree left turn and went about a half mile and dead stopped again.  It sat there about 10 sec. and made a 90 degree to the right. This time it went over the trees into the horizon and we never saw it again.  My brother-in-law wanted to get in the car and chase it but I told him it was probably long gone. There is nothing man made, to my knowledge, that can travel that fast, hover without making a sound and stop dead still when it stops.  All of this lasted, maybe, 3 or4 minutes but it seemed like a lot longer. I didn't tell many people because I thought they would just laugh. Since then, my brother-in-law has passed away and I've wished a thousand times I would have told the authorities and tried to find out what it was.  I've heard many stories similar to mine through the years. I've thought about being hypnotized to relive the experience.  I don't know where it came from or what it was but it was real.

   "text":"Crystal clear sky, White Mountains, NH (checking out satellites) tracking a satellite it stopped, four (whatevers) shot out 4 direction UFO or Satellite/s (approximately early autumn 1979)   My best friend and I went camping one more time before school kicked in for the year. We often camped in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, usually hitch hiking from Boston and back again. After camping over the weekend we started out heading for home it was late in the day/early evening so we decided we would hang out one more night. Not wanting to set up a tent or light a fire, we decided to crawl into our down sleeping bags to keep warm and just go to sleep. We used the porch of the old ranger‚Äôs station in Franconia Notch at the base of where ‚ÄúThe Old Man of The Mountain‚Äù used to be. (Above profile lake)  There was already snow in the mountains and the wind was whipping and freezing so we turned the log benches on their sides and slept behind them. We got up real early because the moon was just coming up and reflecting off the lake (approximately 3:00 AM), It was so beautiful out so we walked around a bit on the side of the highway (next to the lake) so we could get a clear view of the sky. The sky was so clear you could almost reach out and touch the stars. We always liked to look for and track satellites across the sky (which was easy to do in the mountains away from the city lights) especially this morning since the sky was so clear. Spotting a couple of satellites over a period of a half hour we started to walk back to the rangers cabin, ‚Äúlets see if we can spot one more‚Äù before loosing the view under the cabins porch roof. Looking up we both spotted a satellite, I remember saying; ‚ÄúCool, huh‚Äù? Then it just stopped and we said at the same time: ‚Äúwhere did it go‚Äù?  In one split second four additional (whatever‚Äôs‚Äô?) shot out across the sky in four opposite directions from where we were looking. These four objects traveled across the sky in four directions beyond and out of our site, then just as fast they all came back to the same spot where we last saw the satellite stop. It then continued across the sky as any normal satellite would. In my opinion unless we have the technology to create a spacecraft that can travel at the speeds we witnessed that morning, (Satellite speed) then shoot out four additional objects at approximately six to ten times faster than the original track of what we thought was a satellite and at the distances all four objects traveled and back again is beyond our comprehension. It almost seemed like it was creating a grid and mapping the area. Like taking a picture of the mountains or something?  Who knows how many stops it was making and how many times it was projecting out these four objects.

This took place in October or November of 1976.  All three of us (my mother, my cousin and I) were born and raised in the Laredo. I had come to Laredo to visit my family, as I had been living in Mexico since 1956.   My cousins knew I was interested in UFOs and that I believed there was life in other planets.  They told me that there had been a lot of sightings recently in Laredo with people calling in to tv & radio stations etc. about it.  That afternoon, my cousin drove my mother and me to her house.  She parked her car on Davis St. looking north to let us out and then she started yelling, \"The thing! The thing!\" I looked at her and said, \"What thing?\"  She then pointed straight ahead and again repeated the same words.  I looked towards where she was pointing and a short distance away, hovering right above the trees was The  Thing.  It was dusk and I could see clearly the oval shaped ufo with lighted windows all around it.  As my cousing changed shifts to drive toward! s it, it zipped away in an instant.  One minute it was there, the next it was gone.  We were very excited about our experience which I have never forgotten and still tell people about it, especially because it was such a close encounter.  It wasn't like way up in the sky and is it or isn't it.  We know what we saw.   At that time it didn't occur to any of us to report it.

   "text":"Large unidentified object seen in the sky in Meriden, Connecticut, in the late 1970's. This event happened when I was a child, so I am unsure of the exact year or more specifically the exact date and time.  My best guess is the late 70s. My then sister-in-law (She is no longer my sister-in-law and unfortunely have lost contact with her.) and I was coming out of her apartment which was a two family house at the end of a dead end road in Meriden to go to the car.  It was just around 8 p.m.. I am unsure as to were we were going but I think she was giving me a ride back to my house in Southington. We walked down a set of steep steps going down to the car (at that time, noticed nothing in the sky even being up at a higher level).  By the time we got down to the road at the car, we started seeing some very large object in the sky which was moving very slowly and seemed to just appear from a set of trees to the right.  As I said, I was a child at the time so details are sketchy.  What I do remember is it was very large 200-300 feet, it was oval in shaped, many lights around the edges and I believe the object was a dark gun metal color. Me and my sister-in-law were pretty scared at the time.  The object just appeared to be hovering or stopped.  Then ever so slowly it would move.  We got in the car and started to drive down the road.  As we were driving down the road, we saw someone walking on the side of the road.  My sister-in-law stopped and said to this guy who was probably about in his 30s \"Do you see what we are seeing?\".  I remember he said 'Yea, What is that?\".  My sister-in-law said 'We don't know but we are going to follow it\". We continued down the road keeping the object within our vision at all times.  We got on the 691 highway heading towards Southington as that appeared where it was heading.  The object picked up some speed but was still flying low.  When we were on the highway, we saw a bunch of cars slow down and put their brake lights on as I am sure they were just as curious to what this was.  It was getting a little more difficult to follow it once on the highway because the object did pick up speed. As we went by high cliffs (that were near Hubbard Park) that were on the right side of the highway we lost track of the object.  After we got past the cliffs, we looked in the sky to see where it was and it was gone. As I said, unfortunetly, I am not in contact with my now ex-sister in law anymore as she would probably remember more details of the event then me because she was mouch older. Even years after this happened, I remember her saying to me....'Do you remember that night we saw that thing in the sky?\".  Since then, I've always been curious as to if any other reports came out around this time and saw the same thing as we did.

In the summer of 1977 as I walked back towards my home from the park in our neighborhood, in a small housing development, I noticed a very large but quiet UFO hovering over the tree tops.  The object captivated me.  I could not take my eyes off it.   Instead of going home, I followed the UFO as it moved slowly across the tree tops in the wooded area that surrounded the development.  I followed the UFO, for approximately 15 minutes, to Quince Orchard Road, and it continued straight into the woods across the road.  (At the time that area was all wooded).  I could not follow it any further. The UFO looked oval/dome shaped.  It was very large.  It was dark colored like gray/black.  It had windows along the top dome section.   Not all windows where lit, but there was some light coming from some of the windows. It traveled very slowly, because as I followed it, it stayed ahead of me but I didn‚Äôt lose sight of it until it went into another wooded area where there was no road. I wanted to see if I could continue to follow this thing, so I caught a ride with a car that came along just after losing sight of the UFO- the fellow that stopped to give me a ride said he saw something.  I jumped in and told him I had seen it too, that I had been following it from Quince Orchard development.   He drove a little further to the little shopping center at the end of Quince Orchard Rd. but it was gone. I don‚Äôt know who that fellow was or if he ever reported the sighting.  But I never said anything to anyone about it until I had been married for awhile.  I told my husband and my four children. I wonder if the occurrence seen in approx June of 1977 was the same sighting I saw!   I think the UFO came from what is now the Seneca Park area.

   "text":"Pensacola, FL- a space craft of immese size appeared without sound In the spring-summer of 1978, my best friend and I were driving on Interstate 10 in Pensacola. We were heading East to Santa Rosa County. The sun had gone down as we traveled on Interstate 10. As I was driving, I was close to the water tower that is on the interstate which is just before the bridge going over Escambia Bay.  All of a sudden and out of nowhere, a space ship was suspended over the interstate before the bridge. There was no sound eminating from the spacecraft however, it was extremely large; almost covering the width of the interstate.  Also, it was vast in height in comparison to a five or six-story building.  Underneath the craft, the structure seemed to be comprised of steel girders with a circular area in the middle of the bottom of the spacecraft. It was lit up so that one could see the structural design of the craft. The main superstructure was very large with colored panels lighting up at times. I recall a red, blue or green, and yellow panel lit up as if the space craft was tying to communicate something using color and the sequence of when the panels lit up. There was no sound coming from this sighting. It was just suspended in space. It was so close to my friend and me. Then all of a sudden the lights went out and in total darkness and without sound, the craft moved over the water tower. It was hovering over the tower when out of the circular area located at the bottom of the craft, a light shown down on the water tower. It was as if the light was searching the tower and nearby land where the tower was built. Again, the lights went out and without and trace of sound, the spacecraft moved a little west and farther into the sky. Again, it was suspended in the sky and the only lights eminating from it were white lights. If I am not mistaken, the lights seemed to be outlining the perimeter of the spacecraft. It has been several years since my friend and I saw this sighting. If I am not mistaken, once the craft had allowed us to see the white lights surrounding the perimeter, it fled in an amazing speed towards the southeast. That was an incredible evening for both my friend and me. Once arriving to my home, excitedly, he and I ran into the house sharing this information with my parents. I called the local newspaper and radio station(s) explaining what we had seen and asked if anyone had seen the same thing to please get in touch with me. However, as was in a lot of cases back in the 70's, the receiver(s) of my inquiries laughed in unbelief. Today, I know this sighting was real. I don't have to prove anything to anyone to the reality of this matter because I, as well as my friend, know what we saw was truth. I only wish I could have communicated with the intellectuality of the spacecraft to understand more. But yet, maybe another time will take place so that intelligence can share and learn from other sources within the universe.

My father was stationed in Baton Rouge for one year working with the National Guard. He was in Engineering. I had the luxury of flying all over Europe with him since the age of 5. I had been exposed to aircraft of all types. Years later, I joined the Air Force and compared all of the aircraft that I saw daily with what I saw back in 1978. I know that I saw a UFO. My mother, father and I had gone to a carnival. We were on our way back home. The entrance to our neighborhood was a long wide tree lined street. There were no tall buildings. We lived in a quiet suburban middle class neighborhood. My father drove a golden 1978 Cutlass Supreme. I sat on the back right passenger side behind my mother. There was absolutely no noise. No radio on. No one was talking. I was an only child. To this day I do not know why I looked out of the rectangular window. The one thing that I clearly remember was that,although it was dark,there was a large moon and the sky was absolutely clear with no clouds. I looked out and up. I watched the biggest craft I have ever seen in my life hovering just above the tree tops. The craft was following our car! I remember bein astounded by the fact that there was NO SOUND! I had ridden on airplanes. I had watched hot air balloons take off. I had been on the ground when airplanes fly low over a parade. The sound should have been deafening. All I could hear was myself breathing. The craft was oval. The top was rounded. For approximately 4 minutes there were no lights. Just before the craft flew away a row of lights came on along the outermost edge of the widest part of the oval. I remember red and cream colored lights. They were not blinking like a turn signal. They slowly faded in an out. And they did not all come on at the same time. It seemed systematic from front to back. I watched the craft follow our car for about 1 minute. It took me that long to find my voice. I said \"Look!\" My dad was driving and could not look. I said \"Somebody! Look!\" Instead of looking out the side window my mom said \"What do you want us to look at?\" I was so frustrated because I could not formulate the descriptive words necesary. My mother was being stubborn and did not look in any direction on purpose. I said \"Dad! Please look!\" He tried to look. To this day, this memory brings tears to my eyes because he tried to look. He could not see from where he sat. During the entire conversation I never took my eyes off of the UFO. What happened next confirmed my belief that this was a UFO. By now, we have travelled at least a mile down the road. The craft had followed our car the entire time. Once the lights came on, the craft simply did a right angle and flew away in an straight line so fast it was unbelievable. The craft did NOT BANK right. I followed it with my eyes as long as I could. This whole event took between 5-7 minutes. I remember thinking that the craft had to be as tall as a 6 story building. Maybe taller. I think that it was as long as a couple of football stadiums. The bottom of the craft was flat. I did not see any windows. I felt that the color of the object was greyish. It was definitely a matte finish. Not metallic.

I was married to another engineering student at University of Idaho and I had just graduated with degrees in Chemical Engineeering and Chemistry and her in Mining Engineering. I was interested in UFOs and felt most were explainable and I was uncertain about the rest.   We were renting a house from my parents which is on the north side of Coeur d' Alene Lake, four miles east of Coeur d' Alene, Idaho.  We had just eaten dinner and walked out onto the front deck which overlooked the lake.  It was after sunset and still light outside.   We were looking out over the lake when a greenish-white glow appeared under the surface of the water.  An object raised vertically out of the water, water running off, it was oval and difficult to make out the exact outline of the object due to the light it gave off and was about the size of a semi-trailer which is only a rough guess.   The object rose vertically for an estimated several hundred yards to where it was above our horizontal line of site and southwest of us.  The object stopped for a second or two and the next thing we saw was a straight white tapering line of white light going from the last point we saw the object going horizontally out over the northwest horizon as a thread thin white line. It appeared that whatever it was accelerated instantly to a speed that made it appear like a straight white bolt of lightning, only that it tapered to invisibly thin over the horizon.   I personally never talked to anyone about this until three years after the event occurred because I was so shocked by how unreal it was and that my mind had no reference for such an event such as objects raising from a lake vertically and then zipping off horizontally like a lightning bolt.  We heard no sound whatsoever from whatever this was.  I have never even heard of reports like mine from anyone, so it has now been an unsolved puzzle in my mind for over thirty years that has only served to make me wonder what on earth is going on and only fueled my quest for knowledge on the subject of UFOs which, as a scientist/engineer, I take very very seriously and would love to see the human race as a whole get to the bottom of this and with full open cooperation of universities and governments, which unfortunately has not happened and is a disgrace.",

   "text":"Very large object seen in mid October 1978 I am a musician and was going home to Nashua from a job playing at the Deerfield Fair with one of my band mates and another friend.  It was pretty cold that night and the air was clear.  As we were driving west on Rte. 101 I noticed a large object in the sky moving slowly from north to south.  I pointed it out to my companions and we pulled over and got out of the car to get a better look. When we stopped the object stopped moving. It appeared to be at least a mile or two away and was very large, about the size of a silver dollar held at arm's length. It was at about 10 o'clock from the horizon. It was an elongated oval shape and perpendicular to the ground. I seemed to have a bump on one side. The object was glowing purple and the raised area was glowing red. There were two rows of orange or yellow lights on the oval part that were flashing in opposite directions around the oval. The overall shape reminded me of one of those children's tops with the lever that you push up and down to make it spin except slightly flatter and on its side. We watched the object for about 10-15 minutes as it hung there in the sky.  While we were stopped, someone in a pickup truck stopped and asked if we needed help.  We explained what we were doing. He had a CB radio in his truck and I could hear other people on the CB chattering about the object.  He looked with us for a minute or two and left.  We finally decided to go ourselves as the object was just hanging there.  When we started moving the object continued moving slowly south and eventually passed from view.  It moved a little slower than an airplane and seemed to move at a steady speed. When we got back to Nashua my band mate's girlfriend was waiting up for us.  She was nearly hysterical.  She had been out at a dance class and on her way home had apparently encountered the same object except that it was directly overhead and low to the ground.  She said that it covered the whole sky. Surprisingly or perhaps not, there was nothing about this in any of the local papers even though there were many, perhaps hundreds of witnesses.

   "text":"Events throughout my life   I am not wanting this to be shown.. I have written several times . Many of my reports do not have accurate dates. I have had several things happen.  Anyway.. I have a question that I am hoping someone will have an answer to.   When I was in 6th grade , approx 11 years old, my family and I witnessed an exstreamly large craft go from the west to the east side of town and directly over our home. It started out looking like a brilliant , bright  white light traveling very slowly from the west phoenix area. We were alerted to it by my brother who was on his way home with his father who lived in Scottsdale. He noticed it while on the freeway and was very concerned to see it still in the sky when he arrived to our home which was at Gaudalupe and Dobson rd. My whole family- Mother ,grandparents , step father and one of my brothers friends- all went outside to see what he was so upset about. We observed this  object coming closer to us . It was , no joke, about the size of a football field. It didn't have lights on it like it looked from far away. As it got closer we could see it was illuminating from within. It made no noise, just a low kind of warm humming sound. Not like a blimp. It was flying  low and it was  exstreamly large. I would say if you were to hold your hand out you would have to put two fingers together to cover it. My step father worked at air research at the time and even he was puzzled as to what it was. It was not a blimp, plan, or helicopter. It looked like it had windows completely around it, or possibly metal  panels and if I remember right it almost (im not trying to make a joke) but it kinda looked like the starship enterprise. Only in the sense that It seemed to have two sections to it. It was moving super slow .When it reached the end of our block it swayed a bit and you could see it was wider that our street. It then sped up and took of ,very fast north east and was gone. Absolutely gone. The next day I said something to my teacher.. He got very excited and made me go to the principles office and draw a picture for the principle. They both questioned me.. My teacher had seen it also and was using me to try to help prove his story.. It was very outrageous and I am sure very unbelievable if you hadent seen this for yourself.. I am getting to my question.. please be patient.  .. Now when I was sixteen, living in the same home, I had a very unexplainable event. I was coming home from my best friend house .. She lived 2 miles from me. I left at exactly 8:50PM .. I know because we use to watch the Waltanns religiously- of all shows!! anyway,  the show ended at 9pm. I was also due in at 9 , if I was late I would be grounded.. At sixteen that is the worst thing in the world to have happen.. My parents were strict and I was never late. So I pulled in front of the house , shut off my VW bug and then I was surrounded by the most intense blue-white light. My car kinda rumbled .. Its very hard to explain. I at the time thought I had been hit by lightning,I could feel the energy. Thats what I attributed it to at that second,  without realizing it was a totally clear night. The color of the light was  not a color I can explain.  It was blueish white. It consumed me and the whole car. Then it was over and I jumped out of the car and ran in. I was greeted with two VERY upset parents. I was an hour late. I had completely forgot what had just happened.. Even when trying to defend myself. I had no excuse and was very confused.. All I know is I left at 8:50 and walked in at 10pm.  I called my friend sobbing, screaming at her for making me late.. She defended the fact of when I left and said I was crazy. I was traumatized because I was not allowed to see my boyfriend for a week, or talk on the phone.. I didnt recall the light thing for about 3 to four years later. To this day my friend remembers the event.. We are still very good friends.. We still cant explain why i was late or what happened.. I am writing wondering if anyone has had a similar event.. If anyone has seen something then while at the same location they have a loss of time or some other unusual event.. Is it possible that the first time we saw the craft it was the first of several visits? I am not making much sense.. I guess I am wondering -if it is possible that abductions occur, do you think they make a planned route that they trav! el?.. Do they scope out , or survey areas and people  first?  I am confused and still want to understand what happened.. I have had 2 other events in my life where I have had the same light consume me. It is an unforgettable color I have never seen duplicated, even in the movies.  Only one of the other  times  I have  a witness to my time loss. Again, at the time you forget what has just happened, and are left just completely confused. .  All the times I remember seeing the light , but never seem to be able to comprehend it or associate with what is or has happened. I am not a very good writer, I hope this makes sense to someone.. I really hope I can get some kind of understanding of this.. Is there any other people in Az that something like this has happened to them? One thing I did not mention.. The friend of my  brothers who witnessed the ship with my family the first time, he still to this day will not talk about it.. He will admit he saw it, but CAN  not elaborate. I tried to talk with him about 6 years ago and he gets all sweaty and freaked out.. He actually almost crys.. He cant talk about it for some reason.. Im wondering if  possibly something happened to him and he remembers it too much.. Or is it possible he had bad things done to him, or ma bey his mind cant comprehend something that happened to him that night? I am hoping someone can give me some kind of answer or insight... ..

   "text":"Hollow Ring Shaped Object During The Day, Just Above Tree Line I saw this as a kid and was more interested if anyone had ever seen a similar shaped UFO.  I was eight years old and my parents and I were visiting their friends, somewhere rural outside of Toronto.  Not exactly sure of where but it would have been in the GTA, summer, late in the afternoon. As the only kid there, I was told to go play outside. The backyard was a large grass area, with large trees( pines and such) and wooded areas around the perimeter of the property. Anyway, I saw a movement in the sky and looked up. Gliding through the air was a ring shaped object. Not a disk, more like a substantial wedding band, with tall sides but a hollow narrow body. There was no noise, no smoke, no vapor. It was moving quite slow and low, maybe twice the height of the tree line.  The outer side of the \"band\" was black and had little white dot lights on it, similar to an electronic score board.  The ring itself did not appear to be spinning, but the white dots seemed to be scrolling around  and changing their configuration, but nothing that I could read.  The little dot symbols seemed very simple, just randomly changing and moving around.  There was no discernible front or back. It just quietly glided past with nothing changing other than the dots.  I watched it quite calmly for about 30 seconds and then it went past the treeline and I couldn't see it anymore.I then went in to get everyone to come out to the front yard to see if we could still see it.  The adults weren't that interested in my rambling about a spaceship and when I went back outside, of course it had not reappeared. Being 8 at the time, I don't seem to have a good grasp of the size. I seem to recall it being small, maybe 15 to 15 feet across. I remember thinking that it had to have very small spacemen or that it was being controlled remotely, being that the shape didn't seem like anyone could be inside. But who knows, maybe it was bigger than I remember or maybe they were really really small, lol. Over the years I have wondered if it was some sort of remote controlled aircraft or weird balloon, etc. but it just doesn't seem plausible. It was definitely flying, with no noise, no vapor, no strings and looked like a simple band horizontally gliding above the trees. I thought I would put it out there to see if anyone has ever seen anything similar ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

Myself and my girlfriend had just picked up my best friend and his new girlfriend who had just gotten back to town, so we all took a drive up to the mountains and as we made the first turn we ended up at the highway at the other end of what is an hour and a half drive depending on your speed and we were just out for the drive, none of us heard any sound or saw anything in the night sky, our drive just began and ended, we did meet with someone who we thought was a serious ufo investigator but he gut took all our information and books we had on ufos and just vanished. There was also an incident in 1985 when I lived in Nevada and 20 miles from the Nevada Test Site, ha, ha  it's not there (right), anyway myself and my girlfriend were taking a late night walk down the towns main road I noticed a white cloud above the desert roadway witch had a bright search light like a helicopter looking for something, then the light went out after about 20 minutes of flashing around inside the cloud, then the cloud turned a bright blue and slowly faded away into nothing and the night sky was again clear.

   "text":"Shining Bright Light, Oval Shaped, no sound This has been on my mind for over two decades.   I was a young boy apox 11-12 years old.  It was toward the of the end of summer as the days were beginning to get shorter. I remember playing in the front yard.  I lived in the Oaks. Its mostly mid-class families.  The sky was gray and somewhat cool as it gets in Texas towards the evening time.  I was on the corner of where our yard where we lived at Briar Oaks and well the cross street was Carter Creek, well it turns into Carter Creek at the Curb by the Royal Oaks Racket Club use to be.   I saw a Bright light hovering above our yard. It as I could tell somewhat oval shaped as the light resemble a floucent light color but much brighter.  I describe it as oval shape as that was how the light extended.   I watched it for- it felt like a long time probably between 10 to 15 min.  It didn't appear to be very high maybe 1 to 2 football fields high. I wanted to get a ladder and get a closer look.  After several minutes of watching it, I remember my neck hurting from staring into the sky for so long.  There was no sound and the craft was just hovering with No moment.   I remember running inside a telling my mom.  I ask if we had some binoculars to get a closer look.   She said \"No\" we didn't. I told her she had to come outside to see it.   Once back outside it was gone.   Later that night I remember telling my mom that we had to watch KBTX Channel 3 to see if anyone else saw it.  The weather man did say something.  I thought that was awesome.  He stated that several other people called in that night about a bright light in the sky.   He laughed, joking and said we all hope it was just a weather balloon with no real explanation.   I hope someone in that neighorhood who saw what I did will also post there experience that day.  I am very surpised with the number of calls the news recieved no one else has placed anything on this website.   I am currently 34 years old and been serving in the US Army for over 15 years.  Everything from that day has kept me wondering for a very long time.

   "text":"Multiple Neon Green Objects Flying In Formation Back in the winter of 1980, I had been spending  my weekends skiing in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  I had been traveling every weekend to the North country throughout the winter, always in the early hours of Saturday morning as I had a second shift engineering job and I would not leave my Massachusetts workplace until 12:30 am.  So, the times of my being northbound on US Route 93 was 2:00 am onward. On the early March Saturday morning in question,  there had been a terrible rain and snow storm.  This storm was typical of the type of late winter storm that occurs in New England.  Because of the weather conditions and the time of night, there were no vehicles traveling, or if they were, vehicles were few and far between.  As I proceeded North conditions remained treacherous.  I had just passed  the city of Concord NH on US Route 93 when the stormy weather suddenly stopped and driving conditions were back to normal.  No slush on the highway, no freezing rain or snow falling.  It was just me and the highway with a smattering of vehicles moving normally in both north and south directions. Suddenly, ahead of me, I saw a strange glow moving south heading towards and directly ahead of me.  This glow was below the very low cloud cover.  I remember I was watching the sky anyways as the storm had just stopped and the driving conditions had returned to normal. This glow was moving very quickly, like a blink of an eye.  Then, the low flying glow became this neon green light.  My view to the sky was keen as the car I owned then had a very large windshield that came up to almost my driving position and provided me with a panoramic view of the sky.  As the green glow quickly came to me, I suddenly saw a large number of what I would describe as objects in the shape of white corpuscles, only neon green.  There were, as best that I can remember, about a dozen of these objects all flying in formation, one after the other passing directly overhead of me.  The last three were abit a skewed to one side but still in formation, one after the other.  I saw these objects fly in total silence over my car moving just under the low cloud cover. My first reaction was to quickly stop my car.  I turned around and saw these objects continue on their southerly direction following the ribbon of highway and disappear into the low cloud cover.  The clouds reflected the green glow. Then they were gone as quickly as they had appeared. I remember thanking God for allowing me to see something that I could truly not explain. I also saw just a very small handful of cars stopped on the north and southbound side of the highway as I was.  I regret not jumping out to talk to these drivers about what we had just seen. I remember this experience as though it had happened yesterday, the vision still fresh in my mind.  I don‚Äôt tell people about it as they would not be able to comprehend it.  I have a BSc degree from Dalhousie University on Halifax N.S.  My career has been in Engineering and up until last year I was a Unix Analyst for ten years with a major American investment company.  I swear that this statement is true.

   "text":"Back in the summer of 1980 I was dating a girl in Hudson MA.  She was taking a long time getting ready to go out for the evening so I went outside and laid on the hood of my 1970 Mercury Montego looking up at the evening sky.  There were some stars out, but not excessive.  After awhile I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  The star, however, stopped amazingly suddenly.  I figured that the actual shooting star must have disappeared behind a nighttime cloud and I must be focusing on a different star.  I kept my eye on it anyway.  It quickly became apparent that the star I was focusing on was something strange.  It was gyrating back and forth fairly rapidly.  After approx. 10-15 seconds of gyration the \"star\" shot across the sky just like a shooting star.  As a matter of fact, it looked no different.  It was too high up for me to make out any particular shape.  It was a white light just like all of the other stars.  I was sort of blown away but then I figured I must be tired and imagined what I saw.  Although I knew what I saw, I could not admit it to myself.  If made me sit upright on the hood.  I was going to get up to go tell my girlfriend what I saw when suddenly another shooting star raced across the night time sky just as the first one and stopped in the EXACT SAME PLACE!  Now I knew I was really seeing something very weird.  It also started gyrating, and traveled in a perfect little triangle pattern, stopped for a minute, gyrated, and took off in the same projectile direction as the first, looking just like a shooting star.  One again, I was about to run into the house to tell my girlfriend what I was witnessing.  The adrenaline was flowing and my heart was pounding.  A third came out of the night sky, stopped in the same place, raced around in a circle (not a triangle) and split really fast just like the first two.  I did not wait around to see it there were any more.  Now I wish I did.  I ran into the house and yelled to my girlfriend, Where is a phone book?  I need to call the Hudson police department.  She sort of freaked out and yelled, what's wrong!!?  Still in the shower, she could not come down.  I saw one of those emergency stickers on the side of her phone and called the Hudson police dept., hear pounding out of my chest.  When someone answered and asked if it was an emergency, I got a grip.  I realized that I cannot embarrass myself by reporting UFO sightings.  That would be absurd.  I hung up.  I never reported it.  My girlfriend politely acknowledged what I saw, but I think that was the beginning of the end. Looking through her eyes, I think she thought I was nuts.  This was either on a Friday night or a Saturday night.  When I got to work on Monday I could not help but to confide in a coworker and tell him my story.  He laughed and said, your full of shit, you read the paper.  I asked him what he was talking about.  He said that there were several UFO sightings reported over the weekend in NH.  None were reported in Massachusetts according to my coworker.  The only one I remember him describing to me was a low down light in a field in NH and other low altitude sightings?  It did not sound like what I saw but the same weekend, never the less.  I tried, tonight, 23 years later, to try to substantiate this to my wife by Google'ing a search for New England UFO sightings hoping to find a newspaper article.  I did find this:  7/7/81 Pittsfield Darryl S. Perrault, 18, Carl E. Perrault, his father, and Ann Delsignore, his girlfriend, saw a UFO through binoculars for 45 minutes. When first seen, it shot across the sky like a meteor, then suddenly stopped. Darryl said, \"It was oval-shaped, with red and white flashing lights around the outside like a ring. No way it was a plane or a sattelite- it shot across the sky too fast.\" N.E. UFO Newsletter #23 Oct. 1981 p. 18  Seems pretty darn similar.  My search was prompted because myself, my wife and my two daughters watched a UFO special on TV and my wife said, girls, don't believe any of this crap.  I of course encouraged them to keep an open mind.  I am a college educated individual who had nothing to gain by making up a story.  I am speaking the absolute truth.

It was a warm evening and i was downtown with 4 friends of mine and we were about to get into a car but we were pre occupied looking at a few girls walking our way when out of the corner of my eye i caught a very large oval shaped multi colored flying object of in the distance...id say about 6 blocks away or it seemed that far...it was silent and i remember that because it was the first thing i noticed besides its colors and shape that really puzzled me because a plane or helicopter that far away would be noisy enough to hear...the sky was clear with no stars or clouds and i got the most eeriest feeling when i saw it...i happened to catch my friend leroy looking right at the same thing i was seeing...we looked at each other sort of stunned and didnt say anything until later when i pulled him aside to ask if he saw what i saw too....he admitted it but we were afraid to tell anyone due to there disbelief and i didnt want to be embarrassed....i never ever told anyone else about this and i am a sane person and know exactly what i saw that nite...i wasnt drinking or doing any drugs at all...it was a sight i will never forget.....it moved very slowly and was about about 60-70 yards above ground heading toward the groundwithin 10-15 seconds it disappeared behind some trees and i never saw it again....the lights were blue, green, white and red positioned all around the object evenly with a bright white light on top slightley higher then the others.....it was the creepiest experience i ever had and will never forget it!",

An oval shaped glowing object raced across the sky above us.  I didn't make any noise, it just flew east to west in the sky.  I was facing south when it happened.  The sky was clear that night and no clouds were present so it could not have been a reflection of light off anything.  I seen it plain and clear!!! A trail of light was behind it from probably traveling so fast!  It dissapeared into the night in about 2 seconds. It was probably 100ft up in the sky.

It had yellow and red flashing lights around the outer edge. It hovered silently across the street from the house. Low in the sky and very visible. There were no windows or anything like an undercarriage. Absolutely no noise and for awhile no movement. Incidentally, across the street from the house was the TRW Valve Division. I usually suspect that often these crafts are not so much otherworldly as they are from a foreign country. Quite possibly this was a spycraft taking pictures of TRW as they manufactured defense components etc. Just my suspicion in this instance, as the craft was hovering above a factory right next to TRW. After approx. 4 minutes, it silently left at great speed in a southwest direction.

We looked up into the sky and to the North, we saw a yellow-orange colored oval (laying sideways) shaped UFO that was slowly crossing the sky from the East to the West. Four white diamond shaped objects appeared from the tail end of the oval and followed it in a straight line. I remember turning to my friend and asking him if he was seeing what I was seeing. He said that he was and that we weren't dreaming.  We watched it for about 25 seconds, then while they were traveling, the last diamond object emitted a bright red light and then shot quicky back and downwards in a arc away from the others. The other three then continued moving West in a straight line for a few seconds, then took off at a high rate of speed in different directions.  Following this, the oval object paused for 3 or 4 seconds then shot into the sky at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed. We watched it until it went out of site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"Multiple objects of differing size and possible jet intervention seen in late evening sky over rural area of Ohio, early 1980's. I was going to bed late one evening and I noticed some lights in the distance through my bedroom window. My room was on the north side of the building and the window is a north facing window. The area where I lived was 2 miles north of town. Pop. 12,000 in the town, 40,000 in whole the county. As I approached the window to see what they were, I observed over 10 small lights which alternately flashed blue, green, and reddish orange. They all seemed to be moving in a hap-hazard manner. I then noticed further up in the sky a much larger elongated craft, this object had the same color lights around it with the exclution of of the reddish-orange. I noticed a steady white light on the bottom of craft off to one end. This white light was not flashing but appeared to be from an internal light source. The distance from my location seemed to be at least a half mile at other end of a valley. The larger object was stationary throughout the sighting till the very end. I aproximate the size to be at least 200 to 300 feet long and 75-100 feet accross. The smaller lights may have been 10-15 feet across. Upon seeing this i called my mother who was in her room adjancet to mine. She looked out her window and observed the same scene. The smaller objects began to move up to the larger craft and back down below the horizon. After 20-30 seconds i spotted the objects rising back to larger craft. After 8 to 9 minutes of this action, I heard a loud roaring sound. We noticed 2 objects heading toward the larger craft but they were different from the others. As soon as i noticed them the smaller objects started to disappear inside the larger craft. The larger craft began to move away from the approaching objects, slowly at first, then at a great speed till it disappeared from view. The approaching objects gave off a loud roaring sound that gave me to believe they were some type of jets. The pursuing objects suddenly had 2 large bright orangish white lights at rear, (I assumed afterburners). The large craft well out ! accelera ted the pursuing objects as they approached the area it occupied. After this sighting, my mother was quite un-nerved and had to sit down for 45 minutes to calm down. Side note: in the area it is very rural and only a few families lived in the area below the where the craft were spotted. Also the closest airbase is at least 80 miles to the west in Columbus, Ohio.

In less than 10 seconds it dropped and came directly at us, almost straight on. In what seemed like only a very few seconds it was on us covering literally miles in only a few seconds and it's emense size literally covered and engulfed our 1979 Gray Chevy pickup. The first fear was of a head on collision. The absolute shock and fear was indescribable. At this point we were both covered in a brilliant and unbelievable lime/florescent green light that completely blocked out any view outside the truck. We were both completely illuminated in green light. At this point I was in complete un describable terror and total shock like I have never known before or since. I turned to my now ex wife literally screaming with out hearing myself, wondering if I was personally going insane or God knows what only to see her in the exact same state I was in. The look of terror on her face was some thing, much like the entire event, that is so vividly etched in my memory. Ok now this is the part that haunts me every day of my life since. My next memory and hers seems like literally a second later from one of shear terror is one of \"Hmmm that was weird\", and looking at her being totally calm and myself the same way. Our truck was in the exact same place on the highway going 60 miles per hour just as it was when we were in total terror what seemed like only a split second before. There was on my part no swerving or even time to react before we went from complete shock to Hmmm that was interesting. We both watched the green oval object fly off in a south west direction, more southerly than it had approached, over the trees and off into the far distance and up into the sky disappearing from sight as it seemed to climb far off in the distance. We continued the last 3 miles to our house on Loop rd. We did not have a watch or a car clock. When we got home it was 9 o'clock. Then I was even more confused. Where had the near hour gone? At this point I called the Oceana sheriff office and made a report, just in case someone else saw or experienced this. The officer was very nice and took it all seriously and stated \" I have known officers that have seen things they couldn't explain too.\"",

A friend and I were walking home on a new street built through a dark field between two new subdivisions.  The stars were very visible, so we were looking at them when we noticed a brighter one, very visible, that seemed to be moving in a linear fashion.  It could have been something very normal, but as we watched, a smaller light seemed to emerge from the brighter light, flying straight down from it, then turning at a right angle to continue flying. We thought this was pretty strange, but what happened next still frightens me! My friend yelled at me to turn and look behind us.  We couldn‚Äôt believe it, but there was some sort of flat-bottomed craft hovering maybe 30 feet or so above a telephone pole that was about 50 feet away from us!  I remember that it was hovering at just about double the height of the pole.  It was so close that we felt that it must be observing us, since we were the only people out in the deserted field at this hour.  We ducked into the low underbrush beside the street for cover and continued to watch. It surprised me that it was not brightly lit, although it seemed that some sort of soft light might have been coming from the top of the craft, because I could make out the outline of the craft in the dark sky.  It seemed to be a little more that 25 to 30 feet in diameter, which was easy to estimate, given its proximity to both of us and also to the telephone pole.  It had a somewhat oval shape, not quite round.  The lights from our subdivision illuminated the bottom of the craft well enough for me to just make out some sort of protruding cube-like structures on the bottom of the craft, and possibly something that looked like ductwork. Later, I realized that the texture of the bottom resembled the flat top of an apartment building, turned upside down. It hovered for quite some time, and it did have a sort of windy, whistling hum to it, but no engine sounds. We really felt threatened, or at least observed, and continued to hide and decide what we should do, feeling quite panicky. We were frantically taking notes together, blurting out the things that we noticed, confirming that it was really happening.  Finally, the craft started slowly moving at the same low altitude to the east, toward the subdivision where we both lived.  We then felt brave enough to stand up, out of the brush, and follow it on foot, since it seemed to be departing.  We followed for a few seconds, then suddenly it zoomed off at incredible speed, disappearing to the east.  All of this with no increased noise. My friend told me to look to our right just as it left, and we both saw a glowing greenish ball of light, electrical looking, float gently to the ground and disappear just a few feet away from us. I understand why people would be skeptical about many of the sightings reported, but obviously, they have never seen this type of craft at such close range.  It did not behave in any fashion according to the technology that we had in 1981, or even still.  And the other craft, further out in the night sky, were also unexplainable. And then there‚Äôs that glowing ball of light. We were both very intelligent honor roll students in the 10th grade at the time, and very credible people who just happened to be in the right (or wrong) place at the right time.

My ex ‚Äì husband, myself and my children were driving home from a family Christmas Party. It was very late and it was very dark because the road we were on was Lakeside Ave Webster Mass , and at that time didn‚Äôt have many light poles. As we came up to the Lakeside Beach I saw to my left just above the trees some type of thing that looked like a huge sled. It was only about 20 -25 feet up.  It had 2 running blades that had different colors blinking. I remember blues and reds, it was so quiet and the air was so crisp and clear that night. All I remember hearing is the crunching of the snow under the tires.  I don‚Äôt know why but I don‚Äôt remember being scared.  The object was probably there for a couple of minutes, I‚Äôm not sure because we hurried home, went to bed and never spoke about it.  I didn‚Äôt speak about it because at that time I didn‚Äôt remember it.  I just found out r! ecently that my  ex-husband recalled everything that night.  When I started recalling what had happened was around 1999. My husband now, myself and kids went up to North Conway, NH, I believe around 2006 for an annual vacation that year.  We were all talking about scary things and I decided to tell them what I had experienced, now remember, I hadn‚Äôt talked about it because I had only just remembered it a few years back.  As I told them about the sled one of my son‚Äôs stopped me from continuing and said, ‚ÄúYes, you told Dad to get back in the car‚Äù.  I looked at him and said you saw it?  He said ‚ÄúOh yes‚Äù my son only remembers a very bright white light. He said that his Dad said, ‚ÄúOh, we better hurry and get home because it looks like Santa is coming‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt recall any of that conversation.  I asked my son how long he remembered it and he said he thinks he‚Äôs always remembered but he too never talked about it until I brought it up.  None of my other kids remember anything from that night. So to make matters weirder my ex-husband did not see a sled type of craft on the left side of the road.  His recollection is it was directly in front of us just behind some house where there was a marsh area.  He explained it was enormous oval shape with many colored lights and a large white light coming from it.  He said he always remembered seeing it but doesn‚Äôt know why we didn‚Äôt talk more about it.  He does not recall any conversations, but said all of the children were awake. I still ask myself why I didn‚Äôt remember something so incredible.  Over the years my son has seen a couple of unexplained objects in the sky. I have never seen anything again although I have had 2 unexplained instances.  The first was I woke up one morning and had a long scratch on my thigh, which has left a scar.  Then another time I woke up with a bad burn on my arm which also left a scar.  I felt no pain until I woke up. I don‚Äôt understand why now I need to tell this story, but I do.  It‚Äôs been bothering me for so many years.",

   "text":"My story is short but True .  This sighting occurred while fishing in the Mississippi river , in the spring of 1983 , probably April, between one and two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon .  It was a crystal clear blue sky , with not even a wisp of a cloud anywhere.  We were fishing from a floating dock , where river pilots , shipping agents and river workers catch their water taxis to the ships.  My fishing buddy and I were using heavy tackle and we caught three large catfish that day.  I was on the westbank of the river facing east , and after casting, put my pole down , sat next to it , with my legs over the side , and leaned back on my elbows , looking above the horizon .   Shortly thereafter , I witnessed an oval , light grey object  - coming from Out of the blue sky , on my left (N) at incredible speed and bolt across it , due south.   The length of sky it traversed was approximately one and a half to two feet of space between outstretched arms. ! It was probably 45 degrees above the horizon or a little higher .  Then it disappeared - Into the blue sky , in a split second.   The total time of the sighting was no more than 2 or 3 seconds max - no wings , no blinking lights , no sound , no sonic boom , no contrails.  It had absolutely no resistance from the atmosphere whatsoever !  I immediately turned to my fishing buddy and asked, ‚ÄúDid you see That ?‚Äù , and he said, ‚Äú See What ?‚Äù ‚Äì well that figures .   My location was several miles south of New Orleans.  It was very high in the sky , 25,000 feet or higher ? ,  and about the size of a BB or smaller,  at arms length , but clear as day against the blue sky.  It didn‚Äôt stop and ask directions, it was in a big hurry.   I felt lucky to see it , even though it felt like I saw something I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see.   It was either a black budget toy that could fly 10 times faster than a jetliner , in 1983 , without wings and that nagging - friction from the atmosphere problem , or ‚Äòsomething even more interesting‚Äô.  This was 27! years a go but I‚Äôll never forget those 2 or 3 seconds for the rest of my life ‚Äì been looking into the whole matter since then , with negative results as to the whole Truth , but quite satisfied with a bias.  Maybe the Truth is too much for us right now ...     - Anonymous ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

   "text":"Two UFO sighting in Two weeks in the summer of 1983, Louisville, KY In June of 1983 my cousin and I (age 10 and 13) had just enjoyed the festivities of Steamboat Days and had a generous curfew of 10 pm.   As we made our way to my aunt's house my cousin and I stopped at the old railroad bridge that had LRS102 radio station's lights on it as it still does today but not working when my cousin said what's that?  I asked him what he was talking about and he pointed to an object that was directly over the Louisville, KY, skyline, he proclaimed its a UFO.  I laughed and said it's an airplane and we watched it as it approached our location on the Jeffersonville  river bank and it soon was clear that it was'nt an airplane at all. I became frightened and my cousin just yelled out beam me up scotty in which I replied to him to shut up. The object was oval shaped with multi colored lights making two rotaions two the left then two rotations to the right, it was completely silent and became more freightened then the craft came down and hovered about 20 ft above the bridge silently with no disturbance to the water below. We watched in awe and fear as it just hovered for maybe two or three minutes then it slowly acended and once it reached an altitude of about 3000ft it zoomed off into the nite sky and left us paniced and we went home excitedly telling my aunt the story who obviously didnt believe us at all. The next day I went home to louisville where I told my older  brother what happened of course he laughed at me and ridiculed me, well later that day we had been watching television when a commercial for the local news came on, the reported Jim Mitchell of WHAS 11 said tonite at 11 a Clarksville, IN man has video of a UFO, my brother looked at me with eyes and mouth agape and I proclaimed\" I told you so now do you believe me?  We asked my dad if we could please stay up to watch the news that it was important my dad thought it was odd that we would care about the news program but ok but your going to bed rite after, so my brother and I waited nervously all evening long until the news came on, we watched the whole program and it never mentioned it once. Two weeks later at around 830 pm, my dad said we need to go to Kmart to get your little brother some diapers before they close so it was my dad, step mom and two siblings in the front and I sat in the bed of the truck wearing shorts and flip flops and no shirt, my dad who was an alcoholic was drunk and drinking and driving along popular level road blasting three dog nite on the 8 track, about two blocks from the Kmart we stopped a redlight on popular level where I could see the Kmart sign all lit up. I noticed something strange, there was a warm breeze raining (down) on me and I looked at my arms and the hair was standing up on them and my neck so I looked up and there was a massive craft like the one i'd seen two weeks earlier but much larger like a mother ship and I could see intricate piping mostly squared in shape and I nearly broke my neck looking from one end to another it was as large as a football field and I began to feel sick to my stomach. I began beating on the sliding glass window of the pickup truck yelling: dad, dad but got no response he was to drunk and the horrible 70's music had drowned out my screams and I looked up again and it was gone, now surely there was multiple people that saw this thing I mean we were not alone at the stoplight and im sure someone saw me looking upwards",

   "text":"Oval UFO with lights, same as Garden City, Michigan, about same time? I've recounted this story to friends over the years but never officially reported it because I figured it was no big deal.  But after searching your database out of curiosity, I changed my mind and thought I'd share my observations. I don't remember the date, but know it was in the summer months of 1983, late evening, about 23:30 hours.  I found an incident in your database from 6/15/1983, at 23:30 hours in Garden City, Michigan.  That date and time are close to my sighting, and coincidentally, Garden City is not far from Waterford Township to the north. Anyway, my friend and I left work late one evening, walking home through the neighborhood behind my home.  It was an overcast night and was very dark.  Suddenly, I noticed the neighborhood around us light up, as if there were a clear night and moonlight was covering the ground.  This caused us to look up.  We saw the clouds opened up above us and a huge oval shape hanging in the sky in a hole in the clouds directly overhead. The shape had a row of large bright lights (which I likened to arc lights) along its center.  It was completely silent.  We stared for what seemed like only a few seconds in disbelief.  In an instant, the object shot straight up into the clouds and disappeared.  I'm very familiar with aircraft and have never seen anything like this.  It made absolutely no sound, and traveled the speed of light. My friend and I discussed what this meant for some time afterward.  I simply chalked it up to being some sort of a spiritual encounter.  Perhaps demons or Angels.  They are known to travel and appear on this planet.  The Bible indicates that Satan and his host have been cast upon the Earth and he is presently the prince of the power of the air.  This is why I never officially shared my story until now.  I just figured it was no big deal and was simply a natural phenomenon that could be explained. However, I was intrigued when I read the description from the Garden City sighting.  The description matches the object I saw, and it was right around the date and time I had my encounter.",

   "text":"Objects over northern DeSoto Parish,  Louisiana  1983 I was going home to a rural area near Shreveport Louisiana with my 7 year old son when I noticed two lights in the sky in the direction I was traveling. They were at a pretty high altitude because I could see them well up and over the tree line. They were a good distance apart so I immediately thought they were a couple of planes either heading for Shreveport Regional Airport or Barksdale Air Force Base.  I took my attention back to the road since it was at dusk dark and proceeded to drive on south towards my home and in the direction of the lights. I could no longer see them due to the trees along the road.  When I got about a quarter mile from my house I came to a clearing in the trees that allowed a good view to the east and when I looked up at the darkening sky I saw the lights again. This time I saw they were not just lights. They were two objects, eliptical in shape, almost oval, and had three lights emitting from them. One of them was rotating on a center axis but neither was moving horizontal or vertical.  I stopped to get a better look and I saw various planes flying around the objects with the familiar red and green lights but the lights on the objects were white, yellow, and red.  My son became frightened at the excitement in my voice so I drove on home.  I ran in to get my wife to come out and look since I estimated the objects were at least 4 to 5 thousand feet up and would have been plainly visible from my home but when we ran back out they were gone.  I looked every night after that for a long time in the same area where they were and never saw them again.

Then I realized the ‚Äòstar‚Äô was getting larger and coming toward my car very fast and was not going down but coming towards me.  Then it was above my car outside my driver‚Äôs side, up quite a ways. This all happened extremely fast.  It followed my car for a few minutes and I was able to tell that it looked as big as a football field in the sky, with some lights around the edge of its kind of oval shape.  I had my window down and it made no sound at all. My little dog was in the back of the car and my camera was there, but I was too afraid to stop the car and get it to take pictures.  I watched it and in just a few minutes, it flew away so fast, I could not believe how fast it took off, going south, and then it was gone from sight.  I went home and told my mom and she said she believed me and had heard similar stories from other people in the area.  I did not report it because in 1984, most people did not believe you, so I just kept quiet except for telling my sisters.

   "text":"Children from small town school see object over town over twenty years ago. It doesn't end there. Ok from what I can remember, I was attending elementary school in about the mid 80,s, I was about 8-10 yrs old and after lunch we went to the play ground, and on the way, there was talk and children excited about an object in the sky.  So I ran to see, when I arrived the teachers and children where pointing in the sky, so I looked an there it was a UFO!!!  What ever that ment  I didn‚Äôt know rather to be excited or scared so I looked at the teachers, they seemed to be fine so it was ok. Thinking back it was very high up possibly miles up and north about one or two o‚Äôclock high, at first, at least to me it appeared to be saucer or oval shaped but definitly chrome in color, and It just seemed to set their for awhile it didn‚Äôt move at all, what was so exciting about that. At least 30 min went by as the children started playing again, then suddenly the teachers started yelling look!!! When I did It had started changing it‚Äôs shape to a tear drop facing down and flickering from a dark chrome color to bright chrome glow, at this time my watch a Dukes of hazard watch started beeping Its horn sound , fuzzy sound but It was beeping and it wouldn‚Äôt stop so I covered it with my hands and continued looking, then it fell in like a controlled fall about a third of the way down and stopped again for a few minutes, I started playing with my watch when all at once some of the children said it was falling to the ground, I looked but couldn‚Äôt find it for a second until it flickered here an there on the way down until I last seen it just above the tree‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt know if it had fell to the ground are not but it was definitly falling down. After that we couldn‚Äôt see it anymore then we went back to class after observing it for at least 45 minutes. No big deal to me I didn‚Äôt even know what UFO was. If I am correct on the date the next day when we returned to school, again after lunch we where playing in the play ground when unexpectedly I‚Äôm  pretty sure of it are we wouldn‚Äôt have been playing out there, the teacher! s starte d yelling at us to leave the play ground, at the same time I Noticed one or two military helicopters just over my head, and that was it for me checkmate I was gone!!! Anyways  when we the children had seen that it was the military and they had landed in the play ground we were excited. I remember thinking they were there for us the children and were going to paint our face‚Äôs  with camouflage like they would at the city fair when they would come. But in full uniform the officers just walked on bye straight to the principles office screw them!!! We later went back to class then soon after my teacher including other teachers where called to the office, and we were subbed by another teacher while she was gone. And that was about it until the next day when we arrived back to school and was told on the intercom that what we had seen was none other than a weather balloon and we were even told on kplc news that it was. So that was that. Go figure!!! Hell I believed It. Until about 20 years later after I had forgotten It all those years, it wasn‚Äôt a UFO that‚Äôs why I forgot about it until I‚Äôd seen a similar event on the history channel, then WOW what had happened all came back. Any way I‚Äôm glad I seen this site on the web I haven‚Äôt really had it in me to tell this story to any one else around here because I haven‚Äôt heard anything about it since don‚Äôt want to bring it up again. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one that remembers it around here. Awe one more thing for what its worth just a couple of miles north of my small town of about 3,500 is a large prison compound it could have had a strange appearance from above. And I also seen on the history channel about UFO‚Äôs a map showing a UFO crash recovery just about 40-80 miles north of my town. about 40-50 miles north of here is a military base called Fort Polk, I don‚Äôt know when the so called recovery took place but it was a long time ago, I guess it would be possible for the craft that I seen to have crashed way up their since it was so high it could have appeared to be c! loser. W ell I guess that‚Äôs about It I hope some one else can explain it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date.  PD))",

I am reporting this incident retrospectively to both assist my recollection of events and attempt to gain a better understanding of what my father and I saw several years ago (between spring 1984 and 1986) when I was about 9 years old.  It was late evening after a baseball game between 8 and 9:00 at night.  After several years of denial, my father recently confirmed that he too witnessed the following events.  After leaving the local convenience store heading towards Leonard, I noticed a cylinder like object hovering nearby.  From my perspective, the object appeared to be the size 18-wheeler.  The object was stationary for about 3 minutes and proceeded to parallel us as my father drove towards downtown.  We followed the object for about 10 more minutes towards Leonard.  We continued seeing the object moving slightly faster than we were driving.  About half way between Trenton and Leonard, the object moved south west over an empty field, staying at the same altitude, and rapidly moved upwards vanishing into the night sky.  It did not resemble the traditional UFO flying disk shape.  The object was shaped like a flattened blimp.  My father described it more as an elongated egg.  I remember that the object was red with many lights--red, white, and possibly blue).  The object was glowing with a dim red.  The edges of the area were glowing a darker red.  Additional red lights flashed in a random pattern at the bottom of the object.  The white lights were along the side of the object.  I believe that the blue or green lights also were along the bottom of the object as well.  At the initial sighting when the object was hovering, the object appeared to have a metallic-like texture with at least one horizontal crease.  It's hard to describe, but the object was more than a form of light; it had an odd, wavy, gridded, metal-like texture to it.  The white lights did not appear round, but rather small squares.  In retrospect, the white light may have been the illumination of the horizontal crease.  The lights also did not appear to illuminate the surrounding area.  I could not see any wings or propellers--as would be on a helicopter.  The object did not make any sound and despite how close it was.  It also did not disturb any of the surrounding trees.  A helicopter that was as near as this object was would have been audible and disturbed the branches on the surrounding trees.  Again, these events occurred many years ago and I wish that I had made a more detailed observation of the events at the time.  However, I was a child at the time and only recently had these events confirmed by my father who was reluctant to discuss these events.  It would be incredibly helpful if others could guide me in the research of this event and other events similar to this.

In the conversation with you, I shared a UFO I had seen about 25 years ago and promised I would email it to you. Last night I was listening to Coast to Coast (as always) and you were on.  You were great and so clear and the main thing I heard from you was send in the report- no matter how long ago- for your records.  In our phone conversation, I promised I would report this to you. It was New Years Eve about 25 years ago. In my living room- I had 2 couches facing each other in front of the fireplace. My dear friend, ((name deleted)), was sitting on one couch facing me and I was looking out the huge window behind him.  He was talking and I saw an object o in the window behind him.  At that moment, I did not know what it was. It was elongated and had lights at each end and in the middle- seemed they were red and green or blue. blinking on and off but mostly on. I was so stunned  as I looked at it and tried to make sense of it in my mind.  It hung for a moment and I was too impressed by it to interrupt my friend.  I could not miss a moment of it.  After a moment, I swear- it went straight up in the sky- really straight up.  Before it went straight up- I tried to tell him \" look backwards and see this\" by then it was gone.  SO FAST- SO SO FAST There is absolute no doubt in my mind that it was a UFO.  It was long-and seemed to have a cigar shaped center and shorter bottom and top level. I know it was something from out of this world.  The bottom might have been longer- Not sure I will never forget it. I felt so at one with it. It is weird but seemed so far away and so close at the same time.  It was so powerful- so clear. The shape was so unusual and difficult to describe.  The lights were not normal lights nor neon. I do not know what to say about the lights-  They were very bright but nothing I know. They were deeply clear like nothing I know.  The lights were sp strong- so clear- so there- I can still see them but do not really have words for them- round/oval/ perfect in dimension.  Distinct- different- just different This is more difficult than I thought- trying to convey what I saw.  What was there-  anyway ,  Dear Peter- thank you with all of my heart for what you are doing.  It was really difficultt for me to write this. I think one reason it is hard for folks to write is because it is so hard to explain what they have never seen before,   Blessings to all living things.  Thank you It wanted me to see it. I am grateful I had the oppurtunity. Very exciiting you saw your first ufo the eve we called. ((name deleted)) Sebastopol, Ca",

This night I noticed a very bright streetlight in the distance. I thought to my self that the light was going to burn out in moment because it was too bright. But instead it started to rise straight up in the air. At a distance of several hundred feet in the air, the oval object turned from bright white to bluish / green color and then despaired in front of my eyes. Just before it despaired I noticed some detailed lines around the object.  Feeling that I saw something exstordinary, I went home and called Kenny Airport and asked them if they had anything unusual on the radar screens. They told me that they could not give that information out. So I told them I wanted to report a UFO.  They did give me a phone number in Washington, DC to call. The next day I called that number and a Commando answered the phone and told me there usually is no activity in the North East reported, and that most of the activity is in the South West. He made me feel like no one really cares, and my report will not make a difference. He took my number and told me he would check in to it. Well the Commando did call me back and told me that there where no reports made.  Years later, finding out about peoples abductions, I came to mind that the object that I witnessed the night was extremely low to the roof tops, which could of meant that I witnessed an abduction. Wanting closure for myself and maybe someone else who might need to hear my report, I decided to finally make my report.  I heard about your reporting center on a documentary \"UFOs Seeing is Believing.\" ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"In broad daylight almost cloudless afternoon a large fat oval \"craft\" instantly appeared and disappeared from less than 1000 ft from my I am reporting this UFO sighting 25 years later because of 2 major points which I feel makes this sighting quite unique. ¬†My wife and I witnessed the brief 3-4 min event from arrival to departure in perfect daylight weather.   In addition, there was also another anomaly that preceded the main object which I feel was associated with it, although I cannot precisely place the 2 together. ¬†These two facets make this a significant, extraordinary UFO sighting.¬†   Austin Tx 1986, Sunday afternoon between 4-5pm.  We had just returned from buying groceries to cook on my new outdoor grill.  So I was outside on my 2nd story apt deck at Sterling Village sitting down watching the fire and looking out due west at the beautiful bright blue sky, almost no clouds, just perfect central Texas sky.   Then to my left I see something dark in the sky at quite a distance in the SE direction that I assumed was a flock of birds.  I turned to look directly at the \"flock\" and observed peculiar spazzy \"wing\" movement, sort of like cartoon bats, not at all bird-like.  So the \"flock\" began to get bigger, not closer, and within a few seconds it became clear that it was not birds but, LARGE crooked zig-zagging dark LINES that were gradually spreading outward from a previously small central point, like a cracked windshield, only this was moving, vibrating.  I also could not quite determine just how far away these lines were since I had never seen anything like this before, but my guess would be several miles, at least 20 or so, about as far as the eye could see fairly clear.  I guess to describe it, it looked as if a sky-blue canvas was being ripped or torn at from the opposite side from me, with darkness behind it. As I recall at this time I could not really think as to what I was seeing; I mean my thoughts just stopped, like an overloaded PC \"freezing-up\".  Now I looked around and saw nothing else in the air but a few sparsely thin wispy clouds.  No birds, no planes, balloons, blimps, helicopters, nothing but still quiet blue sky.  As I looked back at the object(s?) only moments later, it was quite larger now, having at least tripled in size and branching out in long, spider-like appendages within a few seconds time.  It was also vibrating much faster and I was just dumbfounded staring awestruck.  I quite literally went blank for lack of any frame with which to reference what I was witnessing.  NOTE: You must understand that I DO realize this description sounds incredibly absurd,  I honestly do. I am only describing what this event looked like.  Please hear me out.  This is not a hoax.¬†  At this point I was really at a loss for even thoughts as to what this was, and by now I was getting nervous so I again glanced toward the western horizon, bright orange sun lighting up everything and as I turned to look back at the dark lines, a grayish blur INSTANTLY appeared in front of me maybe 800 to 1000 feet to my left at the lowest cloud level.  I stopped to look at it for a moment and almost instantly it changed in appearance and became a defined object, that is to say the surface and edges came into focus and the grayish blur changed ¬†into a solid 3 dimensional object.   The object was a grey blur for only about 2 seconds but the transition from fuzzy-blur to definite solid object happened instantly.  I then remembered the \"dark lines\" in the sky and immediately after this grey object appeared solid I quickly glanced back at the sky toward the south east where the \"dark lines\" had been only to find they were completely gone.  No visible trace remained of that first anom! alous sighting at all.  As large and branching as it had become within less than half a minutes time it disappeared within a few seconds.  But I now had this other thing to look at. At first it resembled a huge ballon-like blimp from a parade float or something being that it was smooth. No parades in town today. I thought it might have been hiding behind a cloud.  A quick scan of the skies revealed no clouds even close to being large enough to have been able to conceal the object.  Within a few seconds, maybe 10 or so, I observed it did not have wings, jets, propellors, windows, lights, markings, nothing I could identify it with.  It was a glossy smooth blueish-dark brown-gray color, similar to that of the submarines I've seen on TV.  It also did not make any movement at all; none at all, like a huge dark semi-flattened jellybean perched upon a ledge it just sat there totally silent and motionless, slightly tilted downward towards my general direction. ¬†Finally about this time I suddenly felt anxious as I finally realized this was not like anything I have ever seen in the sky (or anywhere for that matter). I was still reeling from what I had been watching prior to this object and I was VERY uneasy now. Austin at that time had Bergstrom AFB and I had seen at another time huge military cargo carrier jets circle the city to land at the AFB.  This object could have held inside of it at least a couple of those big planes.  Cliche as it sounds, easily this object was at least as big as a football field.  Easily. At this moment I called to my wife who was inside cutting up the chicken to grill. She told me to wait she was busy and I anxiously yelled for her to come outside right now!  She ran out looking down at the grill (she later said she thought I had burned myself lighting the fire, by the way I was yelling) and I bolted up out of my chair, grabbed her by the shoulders and pointed her towards the object in the sky and ranted, \"Do you see that?! DO YOU!?! Huh!? Answer Me! What is it?\" She was not excited like me.  She was calm and speechless, literally at a loss for words. I kept asking her if she could see it, what was it? and she finally whispered \"I don't know\".  We then heard a man yelling at us from the parking lot by our apartment. \"Do You See It?!\", he asked me.  Yea I see it! Do you?!, I responded.. YEA! WHAT IS It?!  He yelled at me and I yelled back  I Don't know!!! (In hindsight I thought it silly that I asked if he saw it too when he obviously had since he asked me first)  Now this guy was behaving even more excited than I was, he was jumping around and waving his arms, really losing it.  I guess looking for other people but nobody was around close by.  We then heard some yelling in the adjacent shopping center parking lot where several people were pointing in the air towards the thing and jumping and yelling.  My wife and I just looked at it quietly.  I suggested we study it in detail. (I have a bit more to say with regards to a more detailed description of the incident, also regarding my phone call to Bergstrom AFB; they denied having any planes flying in the area). NOTE: It is the two specific moments regarding the objects arrival and departure that completely distinguish this thing from anything then or now that I can think to compare it to.  I cannot emphasize how quickly this thing simply zipped into view, then zipped away silently, instantly, no sound, no light.  As my wife describes it, \"Just POOF! Gone\".  Sorry but i really have to use another cliche: If you had blinked your eyes you would miss it.   A bustling city all around and had you not looked up in the sky you would not know it was there.  I saw so many cars pass by on N.Lamar blvd, totally oblivious to this huge thing hanging less than 1000 feet above them.  Approximate location was just north of 183/research, between N. Lamar & Burnet Rd. Would gladly discuss more detail in reference to this sighting since we had a perfect viewing in broad daylight. I am old enough to recall as a youngster ( when kids used to play outside ) and quite often military jets from the nearby AFB would fly low and break the sound barrier. We always looked around to find the jet. ¬† At no time during this sighting did I hear any sound at all from either the craft which was WAY larger than any jet I've ever seen;  nor was there any sound from the anomalous object that appeared before it.  I have seen the Goodyear blimp from at least 3 times the distance further than this object and I could still hear it's engine. I've said more than you wanted to hear in this text I'm sure but as you might guess, this event forever changed my view on many things in this life.  Up until this 1986 sighting i had little interest in these things. I felt the Star Trek-Star Wars phenom had run its course.  Prior to this sighting and for 20 years afterwards I had virtually no interest in the ufo phenom.  My interest in UFOs has sprung up only in the last few years really after finding so much interest on the www. ¬†   Again, I am sharing this with you for the reasons I stated earlier. I am also hoping to meet anyone who may have seen this UFO. I counted at least 5 people other than my wife and I whom I personally observed watching the object.  I would be especially surprised to find anyone else who witness the \"lines in the sky\" anomaly as well.¬†   My wife and I are both licensed healthcare professionals and we both have at least 15 more good years of service to mankind before retirement. I do not wish to discredit our reputations as they are in excellent standing in our respective specialty areas.  As I hope you can understand,  I do not wish to openly reveal our identities. ¬† My wife especially is in disagreement about discussing this event as she currently holds supervisory positions in and out of the hospital setting.  She dislikes talking about this even with me bec ause \"no one is going to believe it and even if they did, nothing will become of it so just give up on it\".   So I am sharing this with you all without her involvement.  I hope you understand our position.  However, I do hope to get at least one response from you soon.   Thank You. ¬† ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"Three fast moving violently churning out of place red and black clouds The date and time of this occurance is my best guess from memory. I knew what I had taken a close up photo of, but everyone I showed it to back then either laughed, or llooked at me like I was crazy. I put the photos away and for years they just sat in a box. Then I saw the movie Independence Day, and it reminded me of my photos. I had three, but I have lost one which I believe would have been proof positive, since it was traveling away from me and not towards me as they are in the two photos I have and want to send to you.  The location of the photo, was Fox Plaza on Hylan Blvd, near New Dorp Lane in Staten Island. I noticed off in the distance, three very strange looking clouds traveling in a V formation from northeast to southwest. If I were to guess their speed, I would have to say eighty (80) to one hundred (100) miles an hour. As they passed me they were almost directly over Hylan Blvd where the traffice was moving at 45 MPH. They were traveling at least twice as fast as the cars they passed over. As you can see in the photos, the direction from which they came had white and golden clouds, so these three very dark clouds were very out of place. What caught my eye was the violent churning of the clouds. The tops were black, whwile the bottom of each was flaming red. The bottom red part of the cloud was churning up into the middle of the cloud. To best describe it imagine a fuel explosion where a rising cloud of burning vapor is churning up and into itself. From the time I first saw it, and till it disappeared, the violent churning motion was clearly visible.  However, these three clouds never rose but did maintain a constant and steady speed, maintaining their formation.  These clouds did leave a trail which can be seen in the photos as puffy trails of smoke. They made no sound at all as they passed almost directly overhead. As I watched them I had this very erie feeling, and when they passed overhead at about a hundred and fifty feet, the hair on my arms stood up. I am sure that you can determine their speed since there are buildings in the photos. Please look at the puffs left behind, and the white clouds, and then at the UFOs, and how much they changed their shape in a matter of seconds. As I said, the inward churning of these clouds was very violent. I have never had any doubt since I took the photos of what they are. I only wish it were a motion picture camera I had that day so everything would have been recorded in real time instead of snapshots.

   "text":"Two small glowing oval orange objects and one larger triangle craft in rural Oregon. It was Friday before hunting season- so it was either September 25 or October 2, 1987- since Oregon‚Äôs hunting season is always the last weekend of September or first weekend of October (I checked online to see if I could figure out what date is correct using Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife with no success.)  My friend and I were seven miles northwest of Roseburg, Oregon, in a sparsely populated area (no houses for at least a mile away) checking out a hunting location that I was very familiar with and it was just before twilight.  We sat down to rest next to a creek-we were in a fairly deep, narrow valley between two hills-  when my friend noticed two yellowish lights at a distance about two thousand yards up the valley.   At first, I did not think much about it since I knew of a gravel road at the end of the valley and thought it was probably just headlights of a car, and told him of such.  We were about to get up since it was now almost dark-and had about a quarter mile to hike back to the truck-when I again notice the two yellow lights were now closer and heading directly down the canyon towards us. I still did not yet think they were UFO‚Äôs or anything out of the ordinary when all of sudden we could hear animal(s) moving  in our direction away from the direction of the yellow lights- I couldn‚Äôt see the animals since it was almost dark now and the area had enough brush and trees to hide them as well.   At the same time we were listening to the animals, I also started to see small (about 1 inch) red glowing ‚Äúsparkling‚Äù spheres appearing at the base of a tree twenty feet away from us, towards the direction of the yellow ‚Äúlights.‚Äù   These red spheres, suddenly appeared at the base, then started to swirled around the tree, all the time rotating upward, and then just as suddenly disappear once they reach the top of the tree.  More and more red spheres appeared around the trees in front of us when I started to asked my friend if he was seeing what I was seeing (I was worried that I was losing my mind) when he shakily replied, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  I once again looked at the yellow ‚Äúlights,‚Äù which were now close enough to see that they were not yellow lights at all, but two glowing, yellowish/orange, oblong spheres or ‚Äúcrafts,‚Äù- about six feet long and 3 feet high.  The crafts were about ten or fifteen feet above the oak trees and twenty feet apart- still fixed on the same course, now about eighty yards away, and still heading down the valley towards us.   These oblong crafts did not make any sound and did not rotate that I could see whatsoever but maintained a slow, methodical speed and spatial distance between themselves and the trees, all the while moving in our direction.  There was no propeller, wing, rudder or prop whatsoever on these ‚Äúcrafts‚Äù that I could see or detect.  They did not appear to be flimsy like a balloon nor rigid metallic either, but almost smooth, round-cornered plastic looking objects.  In addition, they did not glow from within nor from without, but within the skin of the craft itself.  Also, underneath the two spheres the ground was brightly lit up. The light that they emitted was strange in that you could not see the source of the light emitting from the spheres itself, like you would from a headlamp, instead the it was ‚Äúmagically‚Äù lit up underneath the spheres and the edges of the light did not slowly diffuse but stopped very abrupt‚Ä¶ almost like it the light was contained!?!  This was becoming too much for my senses‚Ä¶ (I will admit I was starting to get freaked out, feeling quite alone even with my friend there in the woods and even though I hunted in this area alone all my life) we both stood up and I said let‚Äôs get the heck out of here.   As soon as we moved, the spheres moved in an instance directly overhead and both of us were now bathed in the light.  I stood, in awe, frozen, looking at these THINGS, when one of the spheres shot out a red glowing disk (the same color of the smaller red spheres) straight upwards and then the red disk exploded in a brilliant flash of red light.   I felt frozen as if I was knocked unconscious and the next thing I know I am running.  My friend is also running beside me and we are both running towards my truck not saying a word when I reach the top of a hill I see another object or craft that is triangular in shape that appears high and quite far in the distance further past where my truck is located. This triangular craft is hard to describe how big it is because I cannot reference how far away it is, but it is definitely triangular and of decent size, as well as, far away.  The craft appears to be more metallic looking, in that it is straight lines and appears to be rotating or spinning and has three sides like a pyramid.  It either has three lights or sides or corners of red, silver, and blue, that either interchange or spins giving it an appearance of blinking or spinning motion.  It also appears that the bottom side arches or wobbles back and forth, giving it the ‚Äúblinking‚Äù or jittering effect?!?.    I cannot describe this craft any further as to the fact that I was moving rather fast.

   "text":"Large oval object with white glowing lights moves slowly above the car My husband and I were returning home between 22:00 and 23:00 on a cold but clear night. On Colorado Highway 7 about 2 miles north of Lyons, Colorado, I caught sight of the underside of a very large object.  It seemed to be oval-shaped, maybe 50-75' long and 25-35' wide; there were glowing circular white lights on the bottom of the object. The lights were bright enough to help me make out the edges of the object.  I could see 4-5 of these lights, which seemed to be placed toward the outer edge of the object.  It was moving very slowly across the canyon, about 20-25 feet above the car. I asked my husband if he was seeing the object.  He did not respond but kept driving, staring intently ahead, and giving no sign that he had heard me.  He did not remember anything about this when I questioned him the next morning. I am presently a psychoanalyst in private practice.  Before I changed careers, I was chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S.  Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer.",

   "text":"U.F.O hovering over trees in Nebraska I was 13 years old when I had my one and only true U.F.O sighting/experience. It was around 10:30pm when my mother, brother and I had just gotten home from an event. We lived on a horse shoe street which was somewhat surrounded by tall trees (50 feet plus). We had just pulled in the drive way and as we were getting out of the car my mother says \"What is that?\" and as plain as day hovering about these tall trees was a U.F.O. My brother says that‚Äôs a flying saucer. There is no doubt to what we are seeing. This is visible no more than 200 feet away. This saucer length had to be at least 6-8 maybe more diesels long all lined up together. I was amazed at what I was seeing. I just could not believe my own eyes. This saucer hovered over these trees for 5-10min. It had several white lights around the outer part. After 5-10min it began to rise slowly and I mean slowly and with in a few seconds it took off at an angle leaving just a tracer of its path and it was gone. I can close my eyes today and see it all over. I will NEVER forget. I look to the sky all the time hoping to see one again.  Also, I myself have experience what I believe was an alien encounter. I believe this occurred after the sighting not sure of the date/time but there was light outside. I was sitting in my bed reading a book and my back is to the bed room entrance. So, I‚Äôm reading and I feel 3 taps on my left shoulder and mentally I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs my brother and as I turn and look over my shoulder I see a white figure with an oval shaped head and black oval eyes and I freaked out . I jumped up and ran out of my house. I‚Äôve seen this figure described on television by other people whom have claimed of seeing aliens but some people say its grey or some color but what I saw was white. It freaks me out to even think about it. I believe there are chosen people to see the things we see and I feel bad for the people that will never truly believe and know that we are not alone.

This window is located in my upstairs den. My house is located along a flight path, so I often see planes landing and taking off. I often track them with binoculars and watch the spectacular sunsets and military jets that are routinely streaking across the sky. My kids and I were on our way to dinner so I took a quick look with my binoculars out the window at a cloud bank. That‚Äôs when I saw an oval/egg shaped object tipping back and forth but going in a straight line. It was a dull brown in color and the sun was behind it. The strange thing is that when I lowered my binoculars in disbelief; the craft was not visible to the naked eye. But when I raised them it was visible again and still going along the same trajectory which was west to east, I believe. I watched it until it went out of sight from my point of view. It was solid and had to be huge. The way it appeared in my view was as clear and solid as planes at the height and distance have appeared to me. A military jet followed roughly along the same path but above it 3-5 minutes later.  I‚Äôve always believed in UFOs but this is my first sighting. I personally believe they are spiritual in nature but I digress.",

Off in the distance I saw an object moving in a very strange way. It was moving up then down very fast then it would move to the left then the right.I had never seen any of our aircrafts shaped like this or move like this. I watched it for about 5 minutes, it was still there when I proceeded to go on to my mothers.She lived about a mile away.She came out and got in the car, we proceeded to go to the store.I backed out and went to the stop sign by her house and there was the object up close now flying very slow over the buildings and trees.The object was very large about the size of a football field, it was mettallic in color, it made no sound, it had no windows or lights, it was between being oval shaped and mushroom shaped.This craft flew so slow it was almost hovering. Now the strangest thing about this! object is coming from the bottom center it had a black tube looking object coming from it about half the size of the craft.Now while I watched this craft I had the strange feeling that it was hunting for something. I watched it until it went out of sight, or as if it blended into the enviroment.I will always remember that day, it will always be very clear in my mind.And then the very next night I went over again to take my mother to the store, we go to the stop sign again, it is around 10;00 pm and there flying at an average speed was many bright white lights flying scattered all over the sky making no sound. When we got home we were watching the news and the castors were talking about the strange lights flying over Andrews Airforce base, and making jokes about them being ufos flying over the base. Now when I saw this craft it was around 11;00 am in the daytime on a gray cloudless day, there were no leaves on the trees,and I saw this craft up close, and I watched it for at! least 10;00minutes. I just want this on record somewhere what! I saw t hat day. I sure will never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"Three large white lights on the underside of an mini van sized ufo at approximately 150 feet away for about ten minutes. I was in my neghbor's backyard shoveling snow off of the basketball half court when I noticed the UFO.  It was to in the front of the house just over the oak tree tops in an opening in the tree branches that made it visible.   I was convinced that this thing was watching me.  It was about the size if a mini van.  It was the shape of a plump M&M candy.  It was inky black in appearance and would have probably gone unnoticed by me save for the lights in it. There were three white lights on its underside. They were about the size of those saucer sleds that kids use. They were not airplane lights but big and round lights. The lights curiously did not illuminate the rest of the object.  It remained absolutely silent and stationary for maybe ten minutes or so.  I was terrified the moment that I saw it.  I also stood motionless the entire time of ten minutes.  All I could do was hope that this was not going to turn out to be an abduction.  I was fearfully dreading seeing those little monsters with big black almond shaped eyes.   Nothing at all happened to me.  I decided to start shoveling again and pretend it wasn't there. The moment that I looked away the UFO left.  I just remember looking down for a second and then looking back up there and there was no sighn of it. Then I ran somewhat toward where the thing was in order to get to the gate and then run into my house.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. That was all that happened. My personal interpretation of this was loooong thought over and pounded through in a lot of objective consideration.  In the end and after many changes in my life and a radical transformation which began in late 1996 I came to a sound and peace filled conclusion.  If I indeed saw something that night (meaning that this was not in my mind) it was unquestionably supernatural. The thoughts that I progressivly began to consider brought more and more confusion, meaninglessness and ultimately despair into my heart.  What would the existence of alien Intelligent life mean to me?  Why would they come here?  Why me?  What does this say about humanity's origen and its inextricably linked purpose for existence and its destiny?  Is the abduction phenomenon real?   I read quite a number of books about all these things.  Many different explanations were offered. The acceptance of any one of them would impact my world view tremendously and therefor my life would be conducted based on my conclusions which I was desparate for.   Years later after putting faith in the God of the Bible and His Son, Jesus, I saw things in a new and clear light.  Mankind is actually created by an entirely supernatural God.  We were created to be his children.  This means that we are in many ways like Him.  One thing is for sure:  He is the absolutely most superior person there is.  We are created as the most phenominal and superior life form, reflecting our creator (in the image of God).  Thus, there can not be any life that is more capable or \"intelligent\" in any way comparable to Mankind.  There are however both good and evil entities called angels (messengers of God. The \"evil\" ones wish to hide and distort the truth about God and thus bring death and destruction to humanity through sin.  God conversly works through His unique and eternal God-man Son, Jesus, to intervine and save people.  Hence, the reality that there is to the UFO/abduction phenomenon can be attribed to these categories:  1. Natural or explainable phenomenon. 2. People who are crazy to one level or another, or on drugs, etc. 3. Secret military aircraft. 4. Evil spirits expressing themselves through UFOs and abductors as an effective means to mislead people into believing in lies about God and mankind.  Lies like \"you are your own god\" or Atheistic evolution theories, various magical, new age, and eastern mysticism worldviews.  The list never ends because there is no reliable measuring tool for interpreting the phenomenon. As a believer in Jesus however, I have made it a priority to either validate or repudiate the Bible as a true book from the one creator God.  A careful search into this will reveal to anyone that the book is fully relable. Jesus can save us and also bring the universe and life into its proper context. This is liberating. \"If you obey my words than you are really my disciples (followers); and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.\" Jesus, John 8:31-32.  Have you experience truth and freedom?

It's size is maybe comparable to an SUV, maybe a little bigger.  Anyway, after 1 1/2 circles, it stops and, OMG!, it turns on a VERY! bright white light that shines directly into my living room!  My two year old by this time has awaken and come in to see what was going on, had fallen back to sleep on the couch, was awaken again by this bright light.  It was so bright and even gave off heat!   By this time I was scared to death.  It was like it had seen me watching it.  So I \"ducked\" below the window.  After a few seconds the light went off and it continued to finish its circle in the yard and then it slowly headed north for about 10 seconds or so, then very very quickly it flew out of sight!

At that time, when I lived in California, I was hiking between 25 and 35 miles each week, both after work and in the evenings. I was returning home from my walk, and was within one mile from my house, and cut across a supermarket parking lot. The supermarket had closed for the evening, the lights were being turned out, and there were only a few cars left in the lot. As I crossed the lot, I looked up at approximately a 30 degree angle, and noticed a tight grouping of 5 or 6 white lights with a \"floodlight\" shining down. There was a mist or haze surrounding the grouping of lights, which were in a non-descript pattern on this object.My first observation of this object would indicate that it was a helicopter with a searchlight shining down. I quickly realized, however, that the object was at a close proximity; approximately one third to one half a mile away, and there was no sound audible from the object. The object was completely motionless.

   "text":"Face to face encounter. When I was a child I dealt with ongoing contact with ETs.  This started when I was very young, around the age of 6.  I was awoken several times to either a blinding white light or white light that flashed twice. This report covers one incident but my timeline is over years. I woke in pitch blackness to a sense that something terrifying was about to happen.  I had a bunk bed with my brother.  I was on the top bunk.  I saw one bright white flash of light and so I lifted my head to stare at our door.  I could hear something coming up the stairs.  I heard it open my older brother's door and then open mine.  Through the door walked 5 foot or so ET.  It looked like a classic gray.  Abnormally long fingers.. three or four of them. Eyes that looked like a classic gray, a slit for a mouth but no real nose.  More of a bump and two small holes without nostrils.  It walked along the wall to my right and was looking down at my brother.  The ET was within arms reach, staring down at him.  I was scared but not so scared that I couldn't react or move.  Instead it was hard to move, as if something was done to keep me in place. It then noticed that I was conscious and looking at it. When it did it snapped its head up and stared into my eyes for a few seconds.  It then leaned a bit to the right and reached up and over the bedside at me with its left hand.  My arm was laying out beside me with my hand hanging over the edge.  I managed to ball up a fist and try to punch it.  I managed more of a tap.  It recoiled its hand back and took a step back as if it were confused.  It then started walking towards the door while keeping an eye on me. A bit of my background:  I am a veteran of the USCG. I work in IT, recently for the largest company in the world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD)",

   "text":"The craft was oval shaped, with lights rotating in the middle of it and a green alien with bulging black eyes. It was Mid-October 1990, I was thirteen years old and was on the phone with a friend when my father came in my room and told me that I needed to feed our dog, which stayed outside. It was around 9:00 p.m. I got the dog food and went to do the chore quickly so I could get back on the phone. It was a clear and cool night. While walking to feed the dog I noticed how beautiful the sky and stars were. I bent down to pour the food out into the dog dish as I stood up, I noticed this oval shaped flying object that had green and red lights circling in the middle. There were windows in the craft where I actually seen a green figure with a huge head and big bulging black eyes. This figure is just like what is reported in most alien sightings. This is how I know that I am not crazy. I seen this way before people went Area 51 crazy like they did in the late 90‚Äôs. The craft was flying extremely low across a field. After staring at it for about 2-3 minutes, the curiosity left and fear took over because it noticed me and started coming my way. I ran straight toward the house. As I approached the steps I looked back as the craft quickly went backwards out of sight. I was upset and got my parents to walk out to see maybe they could see it. They did not get to, it was gone. I knew what I seen. If you tell people this story they think you are making it up. After almost 18 years, I think about the sighting often and have a lot of questions. This sighting happened in Reidsville, GA. I could understand how people would feel this story is far fetched because if I would not have seen it, believing it  would be difficult, especially since I am almost a 31 year old man.

In the car was my sister my cousin whom was spending the night with us that night and I. We took I-75 back home as usual because my father worked 15 min away from where we lived. While on the highway after you pass I-70 But befor you get to benchwood rd exit (note Benchwood rd exit was not there 10 yrs ago)I notiched an circular oval shaped object hovering around the highway ligts. The ufo was very close to us and I could not beleive my eyes. It continued to circul the lights in rapid movements. The ufo flashed with lights that circled around the whole center of the craft. They were multi colored I remeber it was blue and red colored lights. As we passed the craft I looked back and continued to watch it untill I could no longer see it. I asked my cousin if we really just seen a ufo and she replied yes in a creeped out way. What i belive the ufo was doing was getting energy from the lights on the highway to help power its craft. That is what I beleive. I live 10 min from the wright pat airforce base and I came up with a theroy that maybe its a top secert craft they created that can spy. I have allways told everyone about this encounter but never thought about reporting it till watching shows on ufos.

   "text":"Close encounter on Monument Rd., Tawas City.  Near Corsair.  Craft nearly filled the sky between the pines.  Very large, very close. I was driving on Monument Rd. towards East Tawas, around the Corsair cross country skiing area around 1:30am.  While driving, above the tall pines I could see a spotlight shining above the trees, crossing the roadway ahead.  My first thought was the typical helicopters, which my dad always said it was the DNR, that we would see with spotlights at night in the Tawas City area.  As I drove closer, the light was larger and brighter than a normal spotlight I've seen before from a helicopter.  I began to slow down and stare through my windshield as I was coming upon it and was almost underneath.  I could tell it was coming from the right to the left as the beam of light was getting brighter.  When the front end of craft appeared in the opening of the roadway (above the trees by approximately 100-200yds), I realized this wasn't a helicopter.  I pushed my clutch in and pulled over to the side of the road.  The entire front end of the craft was the spotlight.  The best analogy I can give is it looked similar to the battlestar galactica in the first star wars movie.  It was very large and I was almost directly underneath it.  I pulled over, rolled down my window and looked almost directly up at it.  It was moving gracefully and slowly across the opening of the roadway.  The sound was a sound of a light to medium hum.  Almost like the sound of it going through the air.  There wasn't a rumble of an engine sound.  It sounded like when your furnace kicks on and you can hear the air blowing through the vent, except louder.    I remember thinking that this thing was huge.  The thoughts going through my mind where - this isn't a helicopter.  What kind of plane is this?  When I realized the entire front end, which was flattened, was the spotlight, I then looked for wings and there weren't any.  It was moving slowly as well.  I've been in plenty of planes and currently live near an airport, and I know a plane moving that slow isn't possible.  At any rate, when I realized it wasn't a plane, around 1/3-1/2 ! of it wa s above me with the rear still hidden by the tree tops on the right hand side.  I then said to myself, scan this out and I started scanning all over it with my eyes.  The middle had a slowly pulsating red light.  There were many smaller white lights around the perimeter that were spaced, I'd guess, at around 20-30yds each.  There were roughly 4-5 lights around the longer sides of the oval, with the spotlight out front.  After looking at the lights, I started to look at what was on the body of the craft.  There was stuff?  Again, like the battlestar galactica.  Whereas there were tons of protruding parts all over the place.  At this time, I realized I was out in the middle of no where, by myself.  I remember looking to my left out the window into the woods.  When I thought that I was alone out in the middle of the woods, and when I noticed the darkness of the woods, I got extremely scared, like a monster was about to come out of the woods and get me.  The scared/terrified feeling is like you get as a kid and almost become unable to move.  I remember locking my door and reaching to roll up the window and begin shifting into 1st gear.  As I was rolling up the window, I continued to watch it.  The front end was almost now out of sight and the rear end just broke out from above the trees on the right side.  I started to release the clutch and roll the car when the craft changed its speed.  It originally had to be going no faster than around 25-35mph (taking into consideration the distance).  When it sped up, it doubled/tripled its speed.  I looked forward and shifted into 2nd gear just as I saw car lights coming around the bend (just as I was pulling off of the shoulder of the road).  I figured they had to see this.  I began to slow down and they flew by going normal speeds.  I hit my brake lights to see if they would hit their's and no go.  I drove home, told my dad about it, he laughed and said it was probably a DNR helicopter.  I know what I saw.  I had time to evaluate it, it moved very slowly, it was dir! ectly ab ove me, and extremely close.  It did not have wings, it was not a helicopter unless there is one that is of this size, and it did not have an engine sound.  When I stretch my arms out, I can measure that the width of this was approximately the distance of my hands being apart of around 1.5 feet.  Extend that angle out to the length of those pines, then add around 100yds+ above that, and that's the width.  The length was the length of the entire view of the sky that can be seen across the roadway, then minus about 20yds or so.  When the front was about 20yds from being hidden from the trees on the left hand side, only then did I recognize the rear come out from the tree tops on the right hand side of the road.  It continued at its slow pace until it was around almost 1/2 out of view (I could still see the red light in the middle) then it sped up.  Total time from viewing the front of the craft until it was gone, approximately 1min.  I just closed my eyes and replayed the event and it was probably close to 30secs.  Very scary feelings.

I was a trucker and drove throughout north america.  I was parked at the truck stop in .... over night.  I went to sleep around 2130 and shortly after found myself aboard a craft that was white with a blue stripe.  There were windows on both sides but I dont remember seeing any passengers from the outside.  I was within 20 feet of it.  It was shaped like a passenger jet complete with a rudder from the side but had no wings when viewed from the ground underneath the craft. This was the craft I went inside.  The other craft was sguare, like a platform.  There were many beings inside some looked very human but others were quite pale.  They were normal height, all under 5-6 i would think.  We all communicated telepethically.  They were friendly.  I knew this not just because they appeared friendly but i could communicate openly with their minds or at least the mind of the one I assume was the leader.  He was the one who communicated with me anyway.  I never did ! remember everything that happened that night.  I do recollect that part of my memory was erased.  I was made aware of this.  As well it was I believe 19 years ago and my memory isnt that great.  I do remember that i had the propulsion system explained to me in some detail.  I was always interested in mechanical things and this craft was powered by some form of hydrogen.  in the fog they could run forever without fuel by taking in water from the air.  It was a very foggy spring that year.  They showed me 2 fuel tanks that appeared to be white poly.  They were around 2 and a half gallons.  They told me how far they could go on one of these tanks of water, it was very impressive but i dont remember the distance.  They showed off a little bit with the blue and white vessel.  The maneuvers it did were quite impressive.  I was standing beside my truck while they did figure eights over my head.  I became conscious that I was sitting in the cab of my truck on the edge of my bunk.  ! I dont recall how I got there.  It was around 330.  I dont like to call it an abduction.  It was more like a friendly visit.  My diesel was idling all the time this occured.  That is all I am willing to share at this time.",

It had a fairly large mouth.  We watched it for 20 seconds or so longer then all of a sudden it vanished.  Then as fast as the ambient light from my flashlight could move it would reappear.  And it howled again.  It moved a couple more times and howled a couple of more times.  It could move through the brush and the trees SSSOOO  Fast!  I could move around 40-60 feet as fast as my flashlight could move its beam of light.  It would move within a ¬Ω second of one spot to another.  We were pretty freaked out by this time.  I turned all my fishing poles around so the reels were extended outward incase I had to start beating something over the head.  We scrambled to my jeep and got the hell out of there as fast as we could.  My girlfriend cried for hours after that because she was so freaked out. The next day my buddy and I went back there so I could do some investigating and see if I could find anything that would help explain what the creature was.  We eventually called it the (Waubonsee Monster) because we saw it out by the waubonsee college.  Any way I didn't find anything.  No footprints, broken branches- Nothing!  I couldn't figure how anything could move through the brush and scrub that fast.  How anything could move that fast anywhere.   Well going forward. My buddy and I started fishing again for a little while.  We packed our stuff up again and started to walk towards my jeep up a slight hill.  When we got to the clearing by the jeep, where there was also a clearing that opened up to a corn field.  We both stopped in our tracks and coming at us from across the corn field just about 10-15 feet above treetop level was some craft that had quite a few lights on it.  It also had some sort of spot light that it shined right on us for about 2 seconds.  Then it made a 90 degree turn and zipped out of there Very! Very! Fast. The craft did not have any sound what so ever.  You can imagine how quiet a small stone quarry is at sunset.  Well this craft was one hundred percent soundless.  Even gliders have some kind of sound and we could have heard a pin drop 200 yards away it was that quiet out. One or other of the events would have been pretty exceptional.  But to have them happen in two consecutive nights is really pretty profound. I truly believe that what we saw the first night was some type of extraterrestrial.  I know it was not any creature of this earth.  And then the next night to see the craft in the same location.  Pretty neat!!!!!!!!!! I don't know too many people who can say that they have actually seen an extraterrestrial and a UFO like I have.   Well that my story.  Make of it what you like but I know what I saw and truly believe it was \"Out Of This World Thanks ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"Bright white football shaped object, turned neon green and shot off horizontally   While attending a family Thanksgiving in Los Angeles, CA, our family had booked several rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel on Doheny Blvd, near Beverly Hills. Our room was on the 5th floor. Since our room was in the middle of the hotel it became the meeting place for everyone. The first morning we were there, which was November 26 at about 9 am the room began to shake ever so slightly. We turned on the TV to find that there was a 5.4 earthquake.  We were delighted to have a great story to tell when we got home back to Texas. What happened next, paled in comparison to the earthquake. The last night we were there, Saturday November 28, 1992, we ate out and those of us staying at the hotel came back to pack for Sunday‚Äôs departure back to our respective homes across the country.  My husband and children went to sleep around 9:30. My two nephews who had other rooms at the same hotel, came to our room to visit.  The room was sort of a one bedroom suite with a separate living area that had a balcony. We went to the balcony at 10:30, I remember because I checked the time and checked on my family who were all asleep. I was on the balcony with my two nephews ( aged 24 and 26) we could see the layout of the area below which was like a courtyard where people were sitting at tables and walking around. We chatted and enjoyed people watching as well. All of a sudden, as if someone on the roof had thrown it, I saw what appeared to be a football shaped object bright white light come down in an arc (it did not fall straight down, it arched from the roof to in front of us) to eye level where it seemed to hover in front of us. I happened to be looking up at the sky or roof when it first appeared so I saw it from the get go. I remember one nephew saying, \"What is that?\"  The light or whatever it was hovered in front of us for what seemed to be a few seconds then took off like a bullet horizontally and as it did so, it changed color from bright white light to a neon green, with the green advancing from the front to the rear of the object as it changed color, it disappeared into the darkness. Suddenly, we realized it was 3:00 AM, we were sort of surprised that the time flew by, they left to their rooms and we all went right to sleep. The next morning, we gathered our things said our goodbyes and headed to the airport. While on the plane to Dallas, I suddenly remembered and told my husband, \"We saw a UFO or something.\"  He was quite amazed and had me tell him the whole story.  He found it significant that neither of the nephews had mentioned it, and I had not remembered it when we were all together that morning. My eyes started bothering me beginning that day on the plane ride home. I was seeing spots in front of my eyes like you see after flash photography. I assumed it would go away. By Monday, I was trying to get in touch with my nephews to see what or if they were experiencing something. The younger of the two told his mother who told me that in the night of the sighting, he had a bad nightmare that something had him tied down to a table and was trying to hurt him  By Thursday of the same week, my eyes were somewhat better, but the spots were still there. So, I went to the eye Dr. He checked and said that I had damage similar to an arc welders burn at the back part of the inside of my eye. He asked if I had been near anyone while they were welding. I told him no, not at all. He said the spots would go away in a few more days and they eventually did. When I was finally able to speak to my nephews about our experience, neither really wanted to discuss it other than to say it was the strangest thing they‚Äôd ever seen.  Neither of them could understand why it was 10:30 then 3:00 and why time flew by, furthermore none of us could understand why we all seemed to forget about it completely until I remembered. The nephew that had the nighmare said he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it, so I dropped it. Page 2 UFO Experience cont‚Äôd. I became obsessed with this experience.  Since the Internet was not available at the time, I went to the Dallas Public Library. I asked the Librarian how to report a UFO. She turned to a reference book, and gave me two names.  The first of which was in Phoenix, AZ. To this day, I cannot remember the man‚Äôs name. I called him and he took down the incident.  He may have had me make a drawing and mail it or fax it to him. He had the oddest monotone voice, very deep but without emotion or inflection.  He assured me he would look into it.  A few weeks later, he called me and told me that he went to the Four Seasons, he actually stayed in our room (back then I knew the room number and gave it to him-now I can only remember 5th floor) he said that in daylight, the direction at which the bright white object that turned green went on the horizontal level would have taken it into a shopping mall on Robertson Blvd. He said that was not logical. Furthermore, he said that green lights are a phenomenon that occurs around earthquakes and have nothing to do with UFO‚Äôs.   His conclusion was that what we saw were those lights. Obviously, I forgot this man‚Äôs name because he did not tell me what I wanted to hear.  He did not validate what we knew we saw, a UFO.  We knew it was a UFO and have known all this time. He had no explanation as to why the object changed color from white to green as it went horizontal and shot off faster than I can type it. We know what we saw was a UFO.  We were not UFO buffs at the time.  This thing or even seeing it was the farthest thing from our minds.  What I do know is this thing to me was real. It was an experience I will never forget, and it opened my mind to the fact that we are not alone. As a sidebar to this experience, when I took the film from our California trip to be developed the girl that was working at the photo shop asked me who was my trip.  Well, I told her all about the UFO. She told me that on her way to work a week earlier she saw a diamond shaped UFO which seemed to follow her from Plano, Texas, (along FM 544) to Carrollton, Texas, which is where the photo processing store was. Not just her, but suddenly I found out I knew other people who had seen UFO‚Äôs right here in our area. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.",

   "text":"I was followed by an oval shaped object for several miles and it took off rapidly after I shined a spotlight on it. On the night of December 15, 1992, I left Marshfield, MO and was going to visit a friend who lived just outside Elkland, MO.  As I was crossing the I-44 overpass at Exit 100, I noticed a bright gold colored light to my left.  It appeared to be no more than 100 feet off the ground and less than a mile west of me. Hundreds of people reported sightings of mysterious lights in the nighttime sky in the vicinity of Northview, MO (I-44 exit 96) in 1992, and I personally saw lights from a distance many times myself, and spoke to others who saw things up close, but this was by far the closest I had ever been to it. As I traveled west on Missouri Highway 38 toward Elkland, I kept watching this object.  The farther I traveled, the closer it got to me and no matter which direction I was traveling, it was always at my 10 o‚Äôclock position.  This was very unusual given the fact there were several 90 degree curves on this highway.  I could sense that I was being watched by whoever or whatever was in control of this object.  When it got to within a quarter mile of me, I decided to stop and look at it with my binoculars. I made a left turn onto Conklin Road, stopped and turned off my headlights and engine.  The object also stopped directly over Conklin Road about 1,000 feet west of me.  It was about 50 feet above the ground, totally motionless and soundless.  It was oval shaped and about 25 feet in diameter and approximately 12 feet from top to bottom. With my binoculars, I viewed the object for about 2 to 3 minutes.  It was the same color as yellow gold jewelry and had several black dots scattered randomly on it.  It also had a tiny bit of red on the very top I could only see with the binoculars.  It definitely was not a red light and it did not blink or strobe. The temperature that night was around 15 degrees.  I don‚Äôt know if this had anything to do with it, but I could see a distortion around the object similar to what you would see rising from and asphalt highway on a hot summer day. The car I was driving was equipped with a spotlight.  While standing there looking at the object, I decided to aim the spotlight at it and turn it on and off a couple times to see what, if anything might happen.  After carefully aiming the spotlight toward the object, I turned the switch on and off twice in rapid succession.  As I was turning the light off the second time, without a sound, the object went straight west and was completely out of sight in less than a second.  This was the last time I saw the object. What was really strange about this was the fact the object did not start at zero miles per hour and gradually increase its speed, but instantly went from zero directly to something like 2 or 3 thousand miles per hour without creating a sonic boom. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  One of several seemingly high-quality reports from the same source, who describes himself as a public employee, who had a great deal of responsibility.  We suspect tha the witness is a very good observer.  PD))",

It was during my freshman year in high school, during the 1992-1993 school year.  I was 15 years old.  It was around 6:30 am.  I don't remember the exact date or time.  It was day light outside.  I was walking to the bus stop an I saw a craft fly across the sky.  It was shaped like a blimp, but also had some characteristics that are not normally associated with a blimp.  It had a big, orange, oval shaped glow on the bottom of it. It also had lights all over the side of it.  The lights did not all light at the same time.  They each blinked, one at a time, randomly, really fast.  Each light only flashed for a second or two.  They were not in rows or in a pattern.  They scattered all over the side of the craft.  I could only see them when they blinked.  It was a pretty close view.  It was far up in the sky, but definetly closer than a air plane.  It DID make a sound.  I guess it was an engine or hover craft sound.  I'm not sure how to describe it.  I don't clearly remember the sound.  I wondered about it and immediatly thought \"UFO\", but I did not know how to report such an incident at the time and felt shy about it anyways.  This was before people had internet in their homes.  It just flew by.  It was not going very fast, but it was faster than I would imagine a blimp would go.

   "text":"Saw a UFO and spoke to a possible alien. In the fall of 1993 I was working two jobs in order to support my son and myself. My main job was with the Colorado State Police as an officer.  I worked a second job at night. This fall evening I was on my way to work from my home which was in Colorado Springs, Colorado and across the street from the Patty Jewett Golf Course. Backing out of my driveway (my house was second from the corner of a tee intersection) and then moving forward the short distance to the stop sign at the tee intersection, I glanced across the 8th fairway to make sure there weren‚Äôt any wild golfers playing at the time.  As I came to a stop and while looking across to the other side of the fairway, I saw a group of oaks that had been there for years.  They stood about 40 feet high or so.  Just above the group of trees I also saw what I thought were white landing lights such as on every FAA regulated plane that I know of.  These lights were very low to the ground about 60-80 feet high.  I realized that this plane was going to crash and probably into me or at least my block.  I just sat there like a fool and watched the lights approach. I also noticed that this plane was moving extremely slow and thought sure it would hit the group of trees on the far side of the 8th fairway. Then it stopped.  It just stopped in mid-air and stayed there for a couple of minutes.  I then knew that this was not a regular plane.  I backed up a few feet and parked my car to the curb and stepped out.  I continued to look at the object as I walked across the street to the chain link fence that ran parallel with the 8th fairway.   I leaned against the fence and continued to watch the object. It suddenly dawned on me that there was no visible object, just the lights.  I strained my eyes to make out some sort of shape to it but failed to make out the outline. I looked around to see if anyone else was watching this thing but couldn‚Äôt see anyone.  Nobody on the streets, no one on the course, just absolutely no one anywhere around.    I also noticed that there was no breeze, no sound from any direction, no barking dogs,  just absolute silence. I looked back at the object as it began to move toward me again.  It was only 40 or so feet off the ground and about 100 yards in front of me.  Suddenly it rose above the group of oaks along the edge of the fairway and continued toward me.  Once it cleared the trees it dropped back down close to the ground and just stopped.  That‚Äôs when I saw the red and blue lights on the outside of the two white landing lights.  I tried so hard to see some kind of shape but none prevailed.  I could actually see the background and sky right through this, whatever it was. It sat there for about 2 or 3 minutes and began to move sideways.  The  lights were still facing toward me but moving sideways.  That‚Äôs when I saw the outline of the vehicle.  It was cigar shaped with a red light at one end and a blue light at the other.  The white landing lights were in the middle. The only reason I could see the outline is because when it moved sideways I could see the jagged edges of the craft.  (if you have ever seen the movie ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù  with Arnold Schwarzenegger the only way they could see the alien was when he moved and they could see the jagged edges of his body)  This is the way it was with this craft. Being raised an Air Force brat and having lived on more air bases than I want to remember I can tell you now this was no ordinary air craft.  It made no sound what so ever. The craft moved sideways down the length of the fairway (south) until it reached another section of houses where it stopped, rose above the houses and vanished.  I followed in my car until it was gone and then proceeded on to work. That‚Äôs the first half of the story. My night job was manager of an up-scale nightclub and restaurant. I arrived at the club and entered through the front door.  As you come into the club you find a very large raised horseshoe bar to your left and a raised dining area to the right.  A 3 ft. wall separated the entry way from the dining area and the bar on either side. As I came in one of my girls (cocktail waitress) approached to inform me of some issues I needed to attend to ASAP.  As she spoke I looked toward the bar to find 3 or 4 customers sitting and having cocktails. One man was sitting on a bar stool but was leaning back against the bar and staring at me. As I continued to speak to my girl, this man continued to stare at me.  At first I thought he was going to cause some sort of trouble so I kept a close eye on him as well. After my girl left the man at the bar rose and came up to me.  He asked if we could speak outside for a few minutes.  I agreed and followed him outside half expecting to be in a fist fight or something.  We stood in the middle of the sidewalk in front of the club and he asked me if I saw something funny on my way to work tonight.  I asked him how he would know about anything funny I may or may not have seen. This guy told me that they were checking up on me because I was one of the ‚Äúspecial ones‚Äù.  To this day I don‚Äôt know what he meant by that. For twenty minutes he stood there and told me of my entire life from the time I was born to the present moment, reminding me of things I had long forgotten about or just kept secret from anyone else. Then he asked me if I remembered the night (when I was a young boy playing on the floor of my parents‚Äô house) that a red light beam came through the window of the living room, across the wall and floor and then disappear. I told him I had no recollection of anything such event.  He then pulled out a business card and handed it to me.  As he did, I looked down at it as he placed it in my hand.  I scanned it quickly and looked up to ask him something and he was gone.  He was gone. For years I kept this information from anyone in fear of being labeled some sort of crackpot and I didn‚Äôt want to lose my police position with the State. In time I moved from Colorado to California.  In June of 2002 my father died unexpectedly. I returned to Colorado for his funeral and came back to California to my home.  In November of 2002 I went back to my parents‚Äô home in Colorado Springs to have Thanksgiving with my mother and other family members. After dinner, we all sat around the table telling stories and jokes when I spoke up and said that I had a story to tell.  There were about 20 family members there and they were all chuckling as I told the story of my strange event.  When I got to the part about the red light coming through the window and across the wall and floor, my mother dropped her fork on the plate.  Everyone stopped talking.  It was absolute silent when she said that she remembered that like it was yesterday.  She said that this red beam came through the picture window of the living room, ran across the wall down to the floor and across the floor to the opposite wall.  She also said that dad got up out of his chair and went out on the front porch to see where the light was coming from but there wasn‚Äôt anything out front. When mom got done telling her tale of the red light the laughter was gone.  It continued to be silence for several minutes. I don‚Äôt know whatever happened to that business card that guy gave me but I must have lost it during my move to California.",

   "text":"Old sighting of 4 large oval shaped crafts, very low in sky, witnessed by several people. This is an old incident, but I've been thinking about it a lot lately.   When I was 13, my father was taking the trash out late at night, when he came back in yelling that I had to come out and see something. I went outside, looked up, and saw 4 extremely large objects hovering about 40 feet over the trees and houses on my street.  By that time, there were also several neighbors outside as well, watching and talking about what was going on. These objects were all oval shaped, huge, ringed by rectangular shaped white lights that blinked one after the other all the way around the crafts.  They were completely silent, and completely still.  These crafts were gray colored, smooth in appearance.  They were hovering over power lines, and stayed in place for 30-40 minutes. My neighbor called 911, and police arrived.  They stared up at the sky along with the rest of us.  The officer called more police to come and see it until there were about 3 police cars there.  They called the airports around us who said there was nothing flying over our area at the time, even though no aircraft looked like these things did. After some 30-40 minutes of silent hovering, these things just disappeared.  They didn't move, or fly away, they just disappeared.  We all stayed there for about another hour to see if they would come back, but they didn't. My neighbor recorded the whole incident on and old camcorder, but when the tape was later played, you could only hear what was going on, the screen was snow. The police said they filed a report, as this was standard practice when responding to any call.   To this day, my father and I still wonder what this was that we saw.  I would like to get the police reports, but I'm unsure of the exact date, since it was long ago, but the memory of seeing these UFOs will be forever burned into my mind.

I have finally decided to post this sighting after years of debate and finally choosing your site as a safe place to record this information.  Hopefully, others will file their report as well. My friends and I were having a BBQ in the backyard of my friends house during what i remember sometime in July of 1993.  I heard someone say, 'look up' and to my amazement I saw a row or a line of 5-6 off white lights, that would change to red, blue, green colors in a non-synchronized way.  This line of lights were closely linked together at roughly 1,000 ft above the Palouse on the edge of Moscow, ID about 1-2 miles from my position moving silently & slowly East to West.  At first, I thought what I was seeing was a very large plane with lights arranged along the wings but then i realized that planes would not be moving so slowly and I also heard no sound whatsoever. We saw a series of ~5-6 lights lined up in an edge straight row at what i would estimate around 1,000 feet above ground. The lights moved in unison, silent and moving slowly from East to West. It also appeared that the line of lights rotated together slightly around on a center axis as the entire object headed West. It had a slight aura and very subtle vibration as it moved over the town of Moscow to the West.  My friends and I saw this but we didn't contact anyone because we didn't know who to contact. It is possible that it could of been a military craft but my friends and I saw something very unusual indeed. I hope that this information is somehow useful.

   "text":"Enormous UFO Arlington, Texas Although I have given the date of my sighting as December of 1993, I am unsure of the exact date.  I was driving East on Arkansas Lane in Arlington Texas in early afternoon.  As I topped the hill and approached the intersection of Park Springs and Arkansas Lane I saw an enormous oval shaped disk that appeared to be made of highly polished silver, hovering over the City of Grand Prairie, Texas, which is the City to East of Arlington and about 10 miles from the intersection I was approaching.  It seemed to me to be about the width of a football field or two and was much larger on the horizon than the Dalworthington Gardens Water tower that came into view as I approached the next traffic light at the corner of Spanish Trail and Arkansas Lane.  The strange thing about this sighting is that the UFO appeared to be appearing and disappearing as it sort of wobbled while sitting there in the sky.  Although I did not see any airliners at that time, The UFO seemed to be sitting well above the trees that were visible to me and just under a landing flight path to DFW Airport that I generally always see a plane or two making a final approach when I travel East on Arkansas Lane.  Sometime before this sighting, I remember hearing about some one or some group trying to project a picture of Christ in the skyline above New York City and at first I thought that because the UFO was appearing and disappearing that perhaps that was happening here also.  However, this was in broad daylight.  I looked to my left, intending to honk at the white pick up truck to my left and call the driver's attention to what ever this was.  However when I looked at the driver, I could see that the gentleman driving the truck had his mouth open and was looking at the same sight I was seeing.  I continued down Arkinsas Lane and the UFO continued to hover and appear and disappear until I reached the intersection of Bowen Rd. and Arkansas Lane.  Then the UFO disappeared and never appeared again.  The next day, I was again in my car listening to either the local Classical or Oldies but Goodies Radio station, when the announcer made the following addition to a short news break, \"All you people in Arlington, who called in to report what you thought was a UFO yesterday were actually seeing a weather baloon.\"  I was not one of those people who called in, but I do know that what I saw was no weather baloon.  At the time of my sighting, I did not have a computer.  Two years later when I did purchase one, I began a search that continues today for someone, anyone who saw this same UFO  I am unsure of the date and even the exact year, but I know that others must have seen it and either called the authorities or a radio a station to report it.",

I had come home from Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota to enjoy a couple of weeks at home in Georgia.  One evening, my brother, my girlfriend, and I decided to go fishing for catfish at a local pay lake in Henry County.  We started fishing around 9:00 PM that evening.  We hadn‚Äôt had much luck. We only caught a couple of small cats about twelve inches or so.  My brother had been fishing there before, and he told us that the fishing usually started picking up around midnight.  My girlfriend, who was also in Air Force at the time, was ready to go.  However, my brother and I talked her into sticking it out with us. That night, the moon was bright enough so that we could see the top of the tree line against the sky just beyond the damn of the lake.  The night sky was littered with patches of clouds all around. Sometime after midnight, we all saw this object in the sky.  We were looking in the direction of the damn which was to our right.  I believe the damn was to the North of our location.  I can‚Äôt be sure, as I had never been to the lake before.  The object was a reddish orange oval shape that had some sort of a tail or exhaust in the same color as the object itself.  It wasn‚Äôt like any light that I had ever seen before or since.  It didn‚Äôt have a constant solid light color as most lights do.  Instead, it seemed to be more like a ball of lava. I don‚Äôt want to say that it was like a ball of fire, because it had a cooler appearance, almost like the stuff in a lava lamp.  The object was at a lower altitude than the clouds. It did not make a sound at all as it moved through the sky.  We watched it! for approximately 10 to 15 seconds as it continued its straight path through the night sky.  The tail maintained the same distance from the body of the object the entire time.  We finally lost sight of it to the farthest right part of the sky. I have seen all types of aircraft flying at night during my time in the Air Force.  I was in Desert Storm, and I was an aircraft armament systems specialist. My duties were on the flight line.  I have seen shooting stars and meteors before.  I also know what a comet looks like, and they aren‚Äôt within our atmosphere the way this thing was.  This was something that none of us had ever seen before.  My brother and I were talking about it just the other day, and I finally decided to tell someone to see if they had an answer.

I would like to take this opportunity to report a possible Unidentified Flying Object [UFO]and share some insight into the greenish and while lights that are being seen in the sky. Five years ago, in 1993, I had a very close encounter or you could refer to it as a standoff with an Unidentified Flying Object [UFO] in the Reno, Nevada, area.  Excuse my pun, but I may be able to shed some light on the subject of UFO‚Äôs.  I cannot tell you exactly what it was, but I can tell you that it was not a fixed wing or helicopter that was currently known to the general public and there for unidentified. My military background includes an active duty tour in the U.S Air Force as an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist on F-111‚Äôs and other tactical fighter aircraft and over 20 years as a Security Forces Specialist and Supervisor.  I have extensive experience in Search and Rescue Air Support with both fixed wing and military helicopters. In this particular incident, I was working as a Sheriff‚Äôs Deputy on swing shift and had worked overtime until around 0300 hrs. in the morning.  I changed into my street clothing and put my Glock 9mm in my pancake style holster on my pants belt and put another magazine into my rear pocket.  I got into my Chevy 4x4 pickup truck and headed Northbound on highway 395 and to my residence in the Cold Springs Valley area near the Nevada/California boarder. At about 0330 hours, I crested a hill on Hwy. 395 at started to drop down in elevation towards the Cold Springs Valley.  I observed a bright white circular light moving back and forth across the base of Pevine Mountain near the Southbound lanes of Highway 395, which is several miles from the old Crystal Peak Mine access road. The area is about 5400 feet in elevation and the white light looked to be about 150 feet, above ground level or AGL.  At first, I thought that it might have been a Nevada Army National Guard OH-58 helicopter with a search light mounted on it, although I did not remember one on any of the aircraft I had flew on during search and rescue.  I did not see any formation lights, not strobes or anti-collision lights. At the bottom of the hill, I took the exit and pulled up to the stop sign. I sat there for a couple of minutes.  I shut my engine and lights off to listen to the sound of the main roto blades and did not hear anything.  The intensity of the bright light did not change as the object moved in a circular pattern and a nose mounted searchlight or a side mounted searchlight would have varied in intensity as the nose of the helicopter turned. I watched the bright light for about 3-4 minutes, before restarting my truck and turning on to Cold Springs Drive to drive around the dry lake bed.  While driving around the lake bed, I thought that another vehicle was catching up to me, as I would see some light and then it was gone.  After driving around the lake bed, I turned onto Brant Street and drove about 2 and half miles to my residence. As I pulled into my driveway and got out of my truck, I noticed that the very bright light was traveling along Brant Street at about 150 feet above the roadway towards my position. I moved out into the middle of the culdesac where it was dark and just stood there to try to get a glimpse of what type aircraft it was.  The nearest street light was about half a block away, so I felt a little safe in the dark.  My first thought was, \"Great, the object followed me home.\" The object was moving about 15-20 miles per hour and maintaining about 150-200 feet AGL.  I attempted to observe the outline of the object, but the brightness of the white light prevented it, and the intensity was much brighter that a searchlight that can be mounted on helicopters.  The light seemed to form a round disk type area about 100 ft. in diameter and was the only outline to judge the size of the object.  The object stopped moving towards me and remained stationary in the air with no main rotor blade or tail rotor noise. I was able to observe that there was a greenish hue to the white light emitting from the bottom of the object and said in a loud voice, ‚ÄúOh, so that light is actually a low attitude propulsion system‚Äù.  I was surprised when the object moved sideways about 15 feet, as if answering the question. I got the feeling that I was being observed by a FLIR system- Forward Looking Infrared Radar.  I decided to wait this situation out, as I did not want to identify my house with a sleeping family. I was having a standoff with an UFO and I was thinking to myself, I bet they never abducted a cop with a Glock before and reached down and padded my Glock on my hip. I was hoping that the object would cross over me or move past me slowly, so I could get a look at the underside of the object.  The object maintained a silent hover for about 15 minutes as I stood still.  After about another five minutes, I decided to press the issue and threw up my hands and said very loudly, ‚ÄùWell, what are you going do, do something‚Äù. The white light underneath the object became a greenish/ white color, with what looked like greenish water droplets as big as silver dollars spitting out the bottom for about 10 to 15 feet.  Then the greenish, white light shot straight up into the sky and was gone in about three seconds. I hung around for about another five minutes expecting the object to return since we were so close, but the object did not return and I searched the sky and did not see anything except the stars. I had feeling at the time that the object that followed me home may have been a either a Black Project from the Southern Desert area, or just a UFO. I did not mention the incident to anyone at the time as it would not have been politically incorrect to do so and could have been detrimental to my law enforcement carrier.",

   "text":"3 bell shaped objects seen flying in perfect V formation over Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, Michigan I‚Äôm a taxicab driver here in Ypsilanti, Michigan. This incident took place on the evening of Sunday, August 7, 1994, at 2230 local. It was a hot, humid evening, with the temperature in the 80s.  The skies were clear. About 2220, I received a call to pick up a passenger at St. Joseph hospital, in Ypsilanti. I proceeded to cross street, which then became Washtenaw Ave. While heading towards the hospital, I saw, off in the distance, three lights, flying in a V formation.  One was in front, and two following behind on either side, the same distance apart.  They maintained a perfect triangular formation. I lost sight of them for a few minutes, due to heavy tree cover. At first, I thought they might be hot air balloons.  But being it was after dark, I know they usually land before dark, and take of at first light. When I got near Hewitt ave., I broke in the clear, and I could see they that they had moved much closer. In fact, I pulled off on to a side street, and got out of my cab, to watch them more closely. Each object had a very bright white light, and an alternating red and white light on the rear. They weren‚Äôt moving very fast, probably less than 50 knots, and were fairly low. Taller than tree top, but not much more. They moved from the WNW, passed almost directly over me, and continued off to the ESE. There was another car that parked behind me. The intensity of the lights was so bright, that you could see the reflections of the light off the roadway. I also noticed that these objects made no sound at all.  As closely as they passed, I should‚Äôve heard some sounds. When they were directly overhead, and the light cancelled out, I could see the objects quite clearly for about a minute. They were amber in color.  And they were shaped like a bell.  They were darker in the center, and lighter yellow on the points. I continued to watch them as they continued to the ESE, for almost 45 minutes. Just as I was losing sight of them, they appeared to make a shallow bank to the right. I could see they were heading in the direction of downtown Ypsilanti, so when I got back into my car, I called my dispatcher, who was a friend, and without telling him why, I asked him to step out of the office, turn to the north, and look up. After a few minutes, he returned to the radio, and I asked him if he had seen anything unusual, and he told me, yes.  He did. Well, that made me feel a whole lot better.  At least I wasn‚Äôt seeing things. After that, I went to the hospital, to pick up my passenger. After picking him up, I asked him to wait a minute. I then went into the hospital, and went to the nearest payphone.  I didn‚Äôt have a cellphone then. I then called 911.  And first told them that I was an official SKYWARN weather spotter, and that we work with Washtenaw County Emergency Services department.  I then told them what I had seen, and which way they were heading. At first, I thought they might be skeptical. But they took my report, like I was reporting an accident, and then I asked them if they had gotten many reports concerning our visitors. They then told me, that they couldn‚Äôt say. Very suspicious. Before I left, I made a call to a local TV station, and left my story with them. I got the opinion they really weren‚Äôt interested. I then called one of our local 24 hour news stations, and left my story with them. They too were very polite, but all they said were they were going to check Detroit metro tower, and maybe Selfringe, AFB, and ask them if they had seen anything unusual on their radar screens. So, there being nothing else to do, I went back to my passenger, and took him home. Next evening, at about the same time, I got a call to pick up the same passenger again. This time, after picking him up, I went inside, to ask several of the security guards if they had seen anything unusual the past evening. They told me that they were off the previous evening, so they weren‚Äôt there. However, while I was talking to the security guards, two local ambulance attendants pulled me aside, and told me that they had seen the objects. Well, again, that made me feel better. At least I wasn‚Äôt seeing things. While I was talking to them, I saw a state police officer talking on the phone. I made it to point to wait until he finished and I then I asked him if they had received many calls concerning our visitors. He told me yes. That they had received numerous, and numerous was the word he used, calls on these objects. A week or two later, I talked with the commander of the local state police post. He told me that they were, in fact, following those objects. I then asked him what several folks had asked me. What would you do if they had landed?  He never did answer me, but just gave me a grin. Myself. I would‚Äôve probably seen how fast I could drive my car in reverse. A day or two later, there was nothing in the local media.  Radio.  TV.  Or newspapers. However. One of my co-workers had shown me the front pages from the flint journal, and grand rapids gazette. The ufo sightings were full front page news in both those papers. I wish I had saved those papers. I‚Äôve since tried to get copies of those papers, and it‚Äôs been hard to come by. However, those papers said that on the day I had my encounter with those objects, there were sightings all over the Midwest, both on the day and a couple of days on either side. They were seen all over Michigan,  ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.  In Michigan, they were seen in Ann Arbor, cadilliac, traverse city. Ive talked to other people here in ann arbor, and they had also seen those objects. But they kept a very low profile. And told very few people.",

   "text":"U.F.O. seen over Greensboro, N.C. , unbelievable sighting of a Bright glowing object in the sky. Myself and my friend were sneaking out when we were teenagers I'm now 29.  We were meeting 2 girls in my neighborhood and were going to walk up to the local Circle K convenient store.  Well, we met up with the girls halfway, and started walking up to the store.  The neighborhood was a very large suburban neighborhood outside of Greensboro, N.C. close to the Piedmont International airport.  I can remember the night there so vividly, the cars had frost on them that would glisten under the street lights. It was such a cold night, but we were having fun sneeking out walking up to the store, we were about 14 yrs of age.  On our way to the store we were all cutting up having a good time when my buddy who was a jokster to say the least, all of a sudden said ya'll theres a U.F.O..  My initial thought was he is such an idiot, until I looked up and couldn't believe my eyes, their in the dark sky a little above the trees was a huge Bright yellowish oval object slowly careening above the trees.  We all in utter disbelief stood there and gazed at it.  Like I said, it was oval in shape sort of like a football stretched a little.  It Was completely glowing a very illuminated yellowish color, with a little blinking light at the front of the U.F.O. according to the direction of movement. Itwas approximately a quarter mile above the ground about a half of mile from wher we were at.  Without saying a word we all started running toward the object, but all of a sudden it simply vanished leaving puffy pink trails only to be seenin the city and moon lights.  So, with exubilation walked to the store and met w/ a friend who had a driver license and car and he picked us up to go riding.  We began to tell him of what we witnessed, and he sort of just laughed it off until he turned on his radio and radio DJ announced that a bunch of drunks on a Saturday night were calling in reported U.F.O. sightings, but we knew better because we were not drunk and definetaly not crazy. Our friend believed us after he heard the ra! dio DJ. Oh yea, forgot the object was also moving extremely slow and made no noise.  That is what I remember like it was yesterday.  Thank you for reading my story and keeping an open mind.  I could't tell you what we saw that winter night many years ago, but I would sure like to know.  I bet the Government knows.  Thank-You.",

   "text":"Metallic Oval hovers in broad daylight at Great Falls International Airport This sighting changed me.  Previous to it, I dismissed all claims of sightings of UFO‚Äôs as explainable.  However, I saw the object in such broad daylight, in such clear sight, for a period of time, that it was totally inexplicable to me.  I even had time to go inside and get another person as a witness. Unfortunately, I did not think to scramble for a camera or a video recorder.  Although, I do have another witness who saw it as well. I tried for some time to find out whether there were any reports of activity at the air traffic control tower, or any reports by any other civilians; however I was unsuccessful in doing so. Now, I will also say that I did not think of the sighting as a ‚ÄúUFO‚Äù at the time, but rather just something to think about. It was probably 1-2 years later, when watching TV and seeing recorded footage of the same object sighted and recorded by many in Mexico, which according to the program made Mexican News, that I was struck by the fact that I had seen exactly the same thing. I believe it was Easter or around Easter in probably mid 1990‚Äôs.  (I believe it was 1995.  Might be able to reconstruct better timeframe with effort).  I was in my early 20‚Äôs, and was visiting my family.  It was probably between 10am and Noon, it was sunny with a few clouds and was pretty still.  We lived just below the airport,  as it is situated on a prairie rim.  From there I could see the air control tower, as well as some buildings, and of course commercial and military jets taking of and landing.  I was very used to seeing weather balloons, which I could also see very plainly when they went up. What I saw was a shiny object, mostly metallic-chrome-like, not completely round, oblong-round, just hovering in the sky approximately in vicinity of the air traffic control tower.  I never saw it move.  It seemed small, much smaller than even the F-16 jets that would take off.  I do remember turning away and returning minutes later, and it was gone.  Then later it was there again.  There was no movement ever witnessed, and it just appeared to maintain its position perfectly. I witnessed it for minutes.  I went inside and got another person to come out and look at it.  I asked, ‚Äúdo you see that?‚Äù.  ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù they confirmed.  ‚ÄúWhat would you say that it is?‚Äù I asked.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù they said.  ‚ÄúHow would you describe it?‚Äù, I asked.  ‚ÄúLike a metallic object, just floating there,‚Äù they said.  We then returned inside.  Soon we came out again, and it was never seen again. Given the years I had had at the same residence, looking at the same buildings, same air traffic tower, same sky, planes, weather balloons, etc., I am totally convinced of what I saw.  I do not profess to know anything of what it could be. However, I have really wanted to know how to investigate weather air traffic control (FAA) reported anything, whether the Air National Guard also at same site reported anything, and whether there have been any other civilian sightings fitting that timeframe, date, time, location, etc.",

I went to close my bedroom window and spotted a large, bright orange light.  I retrieved my glasses, expecting to see something on fire.  Instead, I saw an oval orange light throbbing in different shades.  I could tell by local landmarks that it was not on the ground, but barely above the northern horizon.  It was between the neighbor's farm and the next road, putting it within a mile of my home. No sound. The light came closer, growing in size, then suddenly started to drift eastward.  I turned off my bedroom light to get a better look.  That allowed my eyes to adjust. I found the sky was alive with tiny specks of light zipping around.  Without movement, whatever they were could have passed for stars. Approximately forty of them.  Some solid white.  Some solid red.  Some blinking red.  Some blinking white.  Some blinking both colors.  Zipping in all directions at various speeds, but some moving so fast, I could barely follow them.   Some would interact. I remember one pair in particular that blinked furiously as they came together.  They spun around each other and then just zipped away at angles and speeds that seemed impossible. I never saw the smaller lights interact with the larger light, but by then, it had drifted behind a nearby woods and was hard to make out. I went to get a second witness to the event.  By the time I got back, all the lights had winked out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It just seemed to be stuck in time not moving at all. I watched it intently almost as if I had no control... until it bolted into the only cloud in the bright blue sky not to return. The speed it traveled was unreal, more of a blur really and at a sharp downward angle. Amazingly it's speed seemed to be instantaneous. Example: like going 0 mph to lighting speed. No one else has ever mentioned seeing this object in the area or County, nor was it in the local town newspaper but it did indeed occur as clear as day.  (Object was located over the Belle Meade Country Club Golf Course right passed the local Airport, we had a private plane at one time and trust me this was no plane.)

I was leaving Angel Hospital in Franklin N.C. late one evening around 22:00 hours. We were heading home toward I 85 in Cummings I believe the road was named 365 back then. It was a two lane back road. It was a very dark clear night. Driving around 55 mph. I notice my three children were looking out the back of my van and I could not see behind me. I asked them what they were doing and they said Mommy we are kind of scared there is something following us it is a bright white light. I asked how long it has been following us? They said shortly after we got out side of town where there was no lights. I looked and seen what they were talking about and I slowed down to about 20 miles mph. It did get closer quickly and it was following us. This road was a back road and we only seen maybe two cars pass by.  The kids stared screaming Mom it is getting closer I looked and it was. I started speeding up to about 55 mph it did to I went 70 mph well it did two. I noticed that the oval shape light was moving in and out in between trees and an unbelievable amount of speed. I knew I was about 30 miles from the interstate I85. I speed up to 80 mph and it speed up to still weaving in between the trees. It scared the scrap out of me. Being chase and not knowing what in the world this craft was. Kids were scared and crying by this time. I increase my speed to 95 mph it did to. Now it is by this time to close and still doing the zigzag through the trees. I was to scared to slow down and scared of going to fast. I saw a light tower ahead and I knew we were getting closer to the interstate. It was almost as time just froze in place a deer just jumped in front of the van and I don‚Äôt know why but I hit the head light button and turned the head lights off and the deer eyes locked into my eyes and it jumped really high and continued to the woods when it landed I had just hit my brakes at that time but not enough to even come close to stop just an attempt to but the deer was on the side of the road in perfect condit! ion and looking at us like we were crazy.  I then saw a car on coming going toward the light it had no more passed my and it slammed on breaks and stopped the car half on the road and other half off the road they got out with doors left open and they were heading for the ditch. I had hit my brakes during this and slowed way down. I think because we were so close to the interstate and lots of lights and activity it retreated and disappeared within a matter of seconds. I stopped and the car that those people that had passed me stood up with their hand in the air pointing at the object. It disappeared. I have never felt so much relief in my life and a since of calmness came about the children and I. Weird it was actually chasing us. Those people got back in their cars and continued going in that direction. I will say I have never been down that road again! I have never experienced anything like that in my whole life and I am now 50.  The technology of this aircraft light or what ever you want to call it to be able to travel at such unbelievable speeds through the tree zigzagging. I don‚Äôt even want to know or think about it?  This really happed! People looked at me as if I was crazy when I told them what had happened but I told them to ask the children what happened on the drive back from North Carolina. When the children came up to me I told them to ask they did and all three at the same time all chimed in telling them the same things I had just told them. The look on their faces was priceless. I was glad that the children were with me but at the same time I wished they hadn‚Äôt been with me. I don‚Äôt even want to think what would have happened if I had of stopped long before we got to the expressway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

   "text":"strange lights around Cody area I had two different sightings in the Cody area, both  around 1996. This was a long time ago but I will never forget these incidents. The funny thing was I didnt really care that much at the time but as the years go by I realize I saw something amazing.  The first one happened in the fields outside of Cody on the Powell highway. A friend and I were driving back into Cody from Powell at around 10-11 pm. We were coming into town and all of a sudden a  bright set of two orange lights slowly lifted out of one of the fields off to the right of the highway.  They were obviously attached to some sort of craft and possibly the light from some sort of engine, similar to a helicopter taking off but it moved slower at first and than faster , it slowly rose up out of the field and shot into the sky gaining speed as it ascended.  We were quite close , maybe within a mile of the object.  It was dark outside so I could not tell what shape the object was but it definitely had a solid mass to it. I would estimate the size to be about the size of a small to medium sized aircraft , perhaps 50 feet across. It had two orange lights that almost appeared to be rocket engines but not exactly. I could clearly see a huge cloud of thick exhaust coming from the object as it moved into the sky, illuminated by its own orange glowing ‚Äúengines‚Äù. It was far to big to be a fireworks device or anything like that. It moved up in an arc but it rose up slowly , not really like a rocket, more like a helicopter. We were in a car and did not stop but we heard no noise which a helicopter that close would certainly have made.   The other strange thing about this is anyone from Cody knows this is only about a mile from the airport up on the hill. If this was a conventional aircraft why would it take off from a hayfield and not the airport, which was only a mile away?  I can not remember the exact date , I would guess this was April or May.  The next sighting was about 8 months later in January. I lived in Wapiti and was driving home from Cody at night. It was eerie and very quiet that night and snowing lightly. As I was driving past the Buffalo Bill Reservoir. I noticed an extremely bright white light to the left of me in the sky maybe about 500 feet in the air directly over the reservoir. This time I stopped my car because I thought it was a helicopter with a search light looking for something in the water. I turned off my engine and stepped out of my car. To my amazement it was dead quiet outside and not a soul was around. Very spooky. I watched the light shining down through the snow and it was mesmerizing. It was a brilliant white , just like a very bright searchlight.  I watched it for a few minutes and then something even weirder happened. As I watched it it slowly faded out like someone turned down a dimmer switch and at PRECISIELY the same time another white light faded on about a mile away toward the dam. The two lights were unmistakably connected somehow because  exactly as one faded out the other came on, almost like the object just teleported to another location a mile away. I suspect it was two different objects that were coordinating their signals. . This actually scared me and I got in my car and left. I never heard a single sound at all. It was absolutely quiet. The lights never moved at all , they stayed hovering in the same spots the whole time.  I have since talked to friends and two other people I know have seen similar things over the same reservoir.",

   "text":"Pulsating white light that disappeared like a vapor. It was the end of a work day (a Thursday or Friday, as I recall) and I was carpooling with another fellow from nearby Benton City, where we both lived at the time. We were driving along a long and relatively straight stretch of road near the Columbia River, headed toward the West. In the distance, staright ahead of us, was a slowly pulsating white light, to the left of a mountain in the area. At first I thought it was the headlights of a plane approaching for a landing at one of the area airports. When the object never moved for well over a full minute, I called my friend's attention to it and we continued to watch for at least another two minutes. Still the object held motionless, but continued to pulsate, at about 4-6 seconds per cycle, I would guess.  We both thought this very odd and were sure it could be no plane, when we got an added shock as the final pulse seemed to enlarge and disspate, as if a puff of smoke had been spread from a central point and then vanished. We did not see this again, but the following Monday, a few days later, he told me of a trip he and his girlfriend had taken over the weekend, toward Prosser, a neighboring city to the West. He reported that they had both witnessed the same type of event again.  I do know that another friend and at least one of my wife's family have seen unusual occurences in this vicinity, as well. And one, at very close range, many years ago when she was a child..",

Some friends and I were driving down a country road one summer surrounded by farms and cow fields.  We stopped the car and were just hanging out like teenagers do.  Out of no where i hear my buddy who was standing about 80 ft away start yelling and pointing up above him.  I looked over and immediately saw an oval shaped craft hovering COMPLETELY silent about 50 ft directly above his head.  It looked mettallic against the night sky with a rotating red light beneath it that was revolving in a circular motion.  It was completely still.  My jaw dropped. I ran towards my buddy and the object in complete shock and curiousity.  The two girls we were with saw it as well and paniced.  They started screaming and crying for us to leave and ran to car.  My friend and i however were nore intersted in watching it or trying to communicate with it.  As soon as i got to where my friend was standing the object shot thru the sky so fast to another point (which looked about a mile away)! that it appeared to disappear then reappear.  Once it reappered of in the distance we observed there were 2 more just like it!  They moved thru the air as if they were dancing following no particular direction.  Just moving erratically.  We stood and watched in awe for about 20 minutes until they all flew in one direction which we then noticed a larger craft that appeared to be triangle shaped with three huge bright white light at each point.  The three smaller craft (appearing as red lights at this distance now) seemed to circle around the triangle as if it was thier mothership?  They appeared to become part of the big triangle one and then split off again and again.  We watched this dance for a few more minutes in disbelief before all the objects seemed to shoot off or disappear.  One of the things that was strange is that we could hear dogs howling and barking for miles as if they were terrified or in pain?  If that makes any sense. We told everyone we knew thinking people would! be intersted, instead, we were ridiculed and made fun of.  So, we all pretty much never talked about it again.  I know what we saw. Im not crazy.  If i wouldve been alone i may have wondered if i was!  However i was with three other people who all saw the same thing.  I went back to the sight many nights after armed with a camera and patiently waited for hours sometimes but they never returned.  Most AMAZING thing ive ever experienced.

   "text":"I didn't believe in UFO abduction until it happened to me. I woke up six months after I had participated in finding a downed plane in the Angela, Montana area.  What was unusual about that event is that I established a grid pattern outside of the FAA grid pattern and the people who came with me to search in the Angela area found the plane only hours after we started that day.  The FAA led search had been fruitless until that seventh day when people were finally willing to listen to me.  I am a sensitive and was led to the area the plane was found by the dead pilot. Six months later, I am floating in the air with this white R2D2 type unit shining in my bedroom under some sort of white beam of light.  I realize I am paralyzed.  These probe type things snake out and attach to my head.  I cannot speak.  My husband is dead asleep.  I can only scream telepathically, \"In Jesus name, you will let me go! I command you to let me go ...\"  Hey, it had worked on what I perceived to be ghouls before. The white unit said, \"Sleep.  You will sleep...\" in this hypnotic voice.  I told him to go to hell.  I was wide awake and we went back and forth while I commanded the thing in the name of the Eloihim and all angels to let me go.  I seemed to be floating above my bed almost to the ceiling with seven things that were making this weird   hum noise attached to my head. This goes on for some time and the mechanical voice keeps saying, \"Sleep ...\"  Suddenly, a new voice starts to speak to the angry and freaked out me who is eloquently telepathically telling this robot thing off, and it is a non-robotic, female voice.  She calms me down.  I ask her why they are doing this to me.  She says, \"We have heard about what you did in Jordan (the town larger than Angela) and we have come to see why you can operate on such a high frequency with your mind.\"  I get very calm.  I end up losing time.  I don't know anything for a time with this humming noise taking over in my brain.  She informs me they are done.  I ask her what they found.  She replies, \"You are ... a secret weapon.\"  I am a pacifist and am very disappointed by this conclusion. I find myself tucked back into my bed and my husband still won't wake up.  I am freaking, but I go back to sleep, still feeling paralyzed.  I wake up, record the 'dream'.  What is so strange about this is I don't believe in UFOs at all at this time.  I have a first cousin who claims she was abducted on Lolo Pass and I have always thought her a nut.  I talk to my husband only about this for years because I am confused to the core over 'the dream'. As a sensitive, I talk to dead people.  Unfortunately, the ETs are making my life too complicated.  They put things into my dreams and I don't like it.  I feel like I'm in some Star Trek episode some nights.  There are definitely a variety of them.  They seem to be extra dimensional.  I prefer a world view that includes my dead mother talking to me or a dead actor telling me he was murdered over these others who are coming through star gates or portals,  Even the little demon type beings are easier for me.  I'm scared of being abducted again.  I'm not afraid of no ghosts.",

   "text":"UFO experience when I was young in Corpus Christi, Tx When I was 12, my friend and I would spend most of our summer vacation hanging out in the neighborhood. We lived on 16th street near where 16th st. intersected Morgan Street and about half a mile from Cole Park on the bay. One day my friend's cousin had visited him during the afternoon and was going to stay the night. So we decided to spend the rest of the day hanging out and when nightfall approached. We decided to show him our late night hang out spot which was an abandoned house next to my friend's house. The abandoned house had a 2nd story patio that could be reached by stairs and from there we could easily jump on the roof. We would hang out on the rooftop there late at night since we did not have school and it was okay with our parents. We would look up at the stars and talk about anything. We'll that night around 1:00am, we decided to go to our hang out spot on the abandoned house rooftop. The rooftop was in the shape of an L and it was not flat but slanted on each side. I was sitting down on the long side of the L shaped roof facing to the North . While my friend and his cousin sat on the short side of the L shaped roof facing West. We were there for about an hour talking about something when all of a sudden I noticed something stranged. As I was looking at my friends I noticed a bright white light appear around us. I was shocked since it was 1:00am and there was no moon visible in the night sky. As I looked up to see the source of this light. I saw a white bright glowing object hovering about 15ft in the air near the end of the of the L shaped roof near my friends and about the size of a small car. This object did not have propellers, wings, or any insignia that may have confirmed it was a commercial or military craft. All of sudden it ceased its hovering position and began to move toward us. Afraid and shocked at what I was seeing I immediatly got up and made a mad dash to the patio and my friends followed suit. As we made our frantic run from the object I looked back at the ob! ject onc e I reached the ground but it was gone. As we reached my friend's house. We were all shivering from fear and we could not come to a conclusion to what we saw. Since then we have kept the incident to ourselves for about 9 years.  A while back I visited my friend, since we have all moved from our original neighborhood, to finally bring this incident to light for us. He was relunctant and wants to forget the incident but from his viewpoint he agreed to settle the matter. He remembers seeing a scared reaction on my face and when he looked to see what was the matter. He said the object was approaching and instantly he and his cousin ran as fast as they could. While on the patio he turned to see the object. He said he saw the object zig zagging back and forth into the sky then disappearing leaving a metallic streak. A while back I saw the documentary about UFO phenomena with Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel and heard about the UFO Center. I felt I should tell the center of my experience and maybe someone else around that area may have reported the same object.",

I've pointed these lights out to my Son and Husband but their reaction is..it's a star.  Well, tonight I saw the biggest and brightest one of all since Christmas Eve, 2008.  The light was much, much lower then previous lights and therefore was bigger they most lights I have seen. I came out my back door around 8:30PM to go to town to grocery store.  I watched the light for several minutes before pulling our of driveway and it never changed position.  Went to townm did my shopping and when I came back out the light was still there. As I drove home (going West out of Denton, TX) I continued to observe the light.  When I arrived at home it appeared to have gone further West of where I had first observed it but still very bright and low.  I mentioned it to my Husband when he came outside and he confirmed that he had seen it earlier...about two hours ago. I have been seeing similar lights now over the past 10 months.  They appear for several nights in a row and then disappear only to reappear later.  Sometimes they come back in different location.  They always have the same appearance.  A even level of colored lights with a singular white light slightly lower to the left.",

One of my cats, \"Patches,\" now deceased,  was acting strangely and wanted out, so I went to the door and followed her out and glanced at the sky in front of the house. Then I saw it.. a large craft kind of oval in shape, about the size of a car, could not make out the shape, it was diffused light, off in the distance, moving very slowly and seemingly very low altitude towards me.  My husband came out to see what I was looking at and I pulled him down the sidewalk, away from the artificial lights of the house, we were standing by the edge of the house, near the garage. We both noticed that the light in the craft was golden in color, and was flickering like a candle.  All the sudden, the entire craft, ship, blew up, I screamed. Pieces of it blew up, down, and sideways, we could watch the metal burning, and dripping, as I watched the pieces fall, still burning to below the tree line and out of sight. There was no sound.. I ran for the phone and called 911 and reported a ‚Äú plane ‚Äú might have blown up.  Then I heard sirens and said ‚Äò Oh someone already had reported this to you? The 911 operator said  ‚Äú No, it was an accident on the bridge, ‚Äú I said, they probably saw what we did and ran into the wall of the bridge.  So I did report the explosion. Then I called our local airport tower, and no planes were reported in trouble.  I called the military in Portland Oregon because they have a helicopter wing NG in Salem , again no planes or choppers missing or in trouble.  I called PDX and reported it to the tower in Portland , and  then I called SeaTac in Seattle area and again reported the incident. Nothing, but they did take my name in case something or someone ended up not arriving at their destination. I even called Evergreen Helicopters which is located about 28 miles from Salem and again, nothing was reported out of the ordinary. Early the 2nd day / morning sometime after midnight, I was so frustrated that I decided to take a chance and called for the number of Cheyenne Mountain in CO.NORAD might be able to tell me something I called and was very fortunate to have a Air Force man take the call, and explained my reason for the call and he promised to look into it and call me back, I thought I would not hear from him again.  I said, \"it could be a asteroid or something\", but I really needed to know what it was I saw.  So as promised, he called back several hours later. He said ‚Äú according to their reports/records, nothing man made entered the Earth's  atmosphere at that time.‚Äù I said ‚Äú You mean it was a asteroid or something ? ‚Äú He said ‚Äú You are not listening to me,  NOTHING MAN MADE and he accented the words MAN MADE,  ENTERED THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME OF YOUR SIGHTING.‚Äù Then it dawned on me he was telling me what I needed to know.  He asked if there was anything further he could do, I said no and thanked him and we hung up.  What was this sighting.. Was it a small craft? Did it blow up or was it shot down?  We watched the molten metal falling, where was it from?   Why didn‚Äôt we hear anything?  It seemed a few mere miles away.. how far away was it?  Why didn‚Äôt someone else report this?  5/30/1998",

It had legs like a spider.  The spider feature was phenomenal to me.   Me and my friend looked at each other and confirmed we seen a cartoon spider flying across the sky.  I will never forget.  It is as good as it gets for a belief that something is out there that isn't human",

We were on a hill situated in the middle of the Transcontinental Pipeline that ran through our property,  This pipeline originates in Texas and terminates in New York.  It is natural gas and carries within its trajectory also, the Viacom cable that lies beside it. The path of the line is about two hundred feet wide, bordered by dense growth and large pines with an occasional home here and there. My Granddaughter and I were in a small tent with openings on four sides, it sat on the top of a hill looking NE on the open pipe line when we saw it. It emerged from the pines below tree top level.  The trees were about forty feet grown for lumber. It  simply glided at that low altitude across the pipeline, across a small country road, over the roof of my neighbor‚Äôs house, on the hill top, and disappeared into trees on the other side of our property. It was oval, but flat towards the edges.  The color was yellow/white or golden and luminous. It seemed to be the size of a large vehicle in length. like a large truck size. in relation to the size of the home it cruised over.  It was perfectly silent.  My granddaughter and I saw it at the same time and couldn‚Äôt grasp what we were observing.  My far sight is blurry so I couldn‚Äôt make out surface details, only the form. I knew a helicopter could fly low‚Ä¶but not without sound. It was, at the closest, about three hundred feet away. There were no other sounds as it was late at night and we were simply out there to look at the stars and talk. The craft glided,  and appeared to be untroubled by obstacles in it‚Äôs path. No other craft that I‚Äôm aware of could hover that low and maintain altitude???   My grandchild has never forgotten it--neither have I.  We were amazed not afraid.  I have a simple philosophy. I believe in everything--just in case. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I was frozen in time. I went in side and channeled them telepathicly. The leader or told me he has comunicated with me for some time. This is true. They are the same type taht went down at roswell. They have large heads and smaller bodies with large almond shaped blacl shiney eyes. long arrms and middle finger. white pastey skin and No hair . I asked mentally why they never took me up with them. H e said they  did not need to because they implanted, undetectable,  micro chips, in my head behind my ears, for communication.They are more advanced than us. I was afraid of judgement before now. I thought you would think I was crazy. I have to let you know this . They are telling me you need to know this. It is true I have channeled them most of my life, if not all of it. My back yard was wooded at the bottom and secluded. We were at the back of the subdivision. The drive was 12 feet higher than the yard. Our neihbors drive way was next to ours. They went to bed early always. The sky was clear. Strangely I had a circular patio installed with out a deck at that time. I said to someone it was a touch down pad for a U.F.O. I was jokeing about it but  I knew on some level before it happened. I do predictive work. They are going to show there selves to all in 2012 .

   "text":"Unsual light seen throughout house late at night. My wife and two young children and their grandmother all lived in a two story home in a very dark and thickly wooded private community in Northern California in August of 1998.  There are no street lights in this area and the nights are incredibly dark. The house lots are huge and far apart and across the street from us was a huge undeveloped tract of Pine forest.  At approximately 2:AM on this absolutely calm and relatively warm summer evening I was awakened by the brightest blue-white light I have ever seen. I was sleeping in my own upstairs bedroom and my wife was in another next door one and my two children in their own rooms as well. Grandma was downstairs in her own bed.  My door to the upstairs hallway, which had windows facing out to the woods across the street, was open.  My room was so immersed in this blue-white light coming in from this wooded area direction that it was blinding. I had to actually shade my eyes.  I was very groggy when I first awoke so I was just befuddled as to what this light could be.  It took me several seconds to wake up. When I became fully awake I studied the light with incredible amazement and curiosity. It was illuminating the entire inside of our house!  I didn't know a light could be this bright.  It was like one of those six foot wide \"Hollywood Premier\" night-beam-in-the-sky lights were being shined right onto and into our house!  This light was steady and unwavering. It had a cool, unearthly, blue-white glow to it. Almost like a welders torch glow but no wavering and flashing at all like a real welders torch would have.  I was unnerved and my mind came up with a \"safe\" scenario that there must be emergency vehicles outside our house and every one of their lights were being shined on our house and lighting it up on the inside.  But then I listened and I couldn't hear one sound outside.  No voices or engines running.  Then I got a little scared.  I just couldn't get up and look outside to see what was directly making this light.  It was a strange \"sense\" of apprehension and fear. I actually felt cowardly for not doing so.  Just then, two minutes after this light first lit up our house I heard my wife in the bedroom next to mine shout out \" what the heck is that light?\"  Her door to the windowed hallway was closed, and still the light was so bright it woke her up as well.  Unlike me she \"bravely\" got up and as soon as her hand touched the hallway door knob to open it the incredible light blinked out.  And as soon as it did...every electrical appliance including the humming refigerator, clocks and clock-radios in the house went out too.  We tried the lights, nothing worked.  My wife staggered into my room and sat on my bed. Like me, she was shaken and said she had never seen anything so bright in her life.   We called the gated community 24 hour security guard house about 1/4 to 1/2 miles away as the phone did work and they reported no outages or calls about anything unusual like people's electricity being out.  We sat there pondering another couple of minutes and all of a sudden the lights and power in our house just blinked back on !  It was all so strange we just sat there silent and dumbfounded.  Eventually we got up and walked down to our children's bedrooms and took a quick non-entering look inside and they seemed asleep and fine so we just went back to bed.  The next morning my wife and I got up and she started making an eggs and bacon breakfast for us all.  Not long afterwards our 13 year old son came slowly walking down the stairs.  I didn't look up but said \"good morning\" as you could hear him coming down the stairs.  He kind of moaned in response and said \" ohhh, I must have had the worst nose bleed of my life last night.\"  We looked up and the front of his T-shirt was partially stained in blood and he had dried blood underneath his nose and down his cheek and chin.  My wife and I immediately walked over to comfort him and then we went upstairs to his room.  His pillow was fairly well splattered with dried blood also.  To this day we don't have a clue as to what happened that summer evening. But the events I am describing happened exactly the way I say they did.  Our son seemed okay after this and I don't recall him ever getting another nose bleed.  But that light.  I still don't know how anything could light up the \"inside\" of a house like that with absolutely no sound.  Was this a UFO event?  I can't say it was becuase I didn't see anything but the light. But, it certainly was a U.L.E.  \"Unidentified Light Event.\"  And it reminded me of the movie \"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.\" ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

During those years i rode a mountain bicycle to and from work daily.A bicycle trail that day i rode on my way back home i saw some black figures in the sky .At first i thought they were large raven sorta black birds or something ,thought nothing of it about 1 /16 away .As i concentrated steering my way down the trail and around a corner of the trail one of the objects somehow focused its attention on me and moved closer in front of me , about 30 feet in front 25 feet in the air. I came to a complete /quick stop on my bike. Then i heard noise to my left ,There were two males doing clean up work (raking weeds ,trash,etc.)About 50 feet across large rain channel/ditch, behind  alot of industrial fenced areas.They looked at what was in front of me and they got extremely frightened .They must of been mexican nationals seasonal workers .They were saying prayers out loud tone making signs of the cross and throwing their tools /rakes /shovels into their truck ,to get out of there in a hury.As for me ,i stayed still kinda frightened but ,curious at the same time.I took my riding glasses off and the object came a few feet closer and stayed perfectly still.It was a pitch black color and no sound came from it .A shape of oval or as  a shape of a large eye ,kinda glossy -it became as it moved up and to the right part of the bike trail.The other 4 or 5 figures seemed to stayed away or as to wait for the one close to me  to rejoin them.After a few minutes ,it slowly went back into a formation with the others and then extremely disapeared fast.       This was amazing for me to see those objects ,on that day ,confusing  although.Because i couldnt figure out what they were . They didnt look like transport ships or saucers ,But maybe a port hole to examine ?Unknown is! what i still call it. But very intelligent is a word to describe that occurance.     After they disapeared i kept riding on the trail back home ,kinda trembling and nervous at what i just saw.When i got home my girlfriend asked me \"What Happened\"? I couldnt talk for a minute still shooken up.I drank water then told her .After i told her she and i noyiced a scent on my clothes.She asked me was i working with fuel or around a generator motor.I told her no I wasnt working around any thing like that . A very strange scent ,almost like the scent around a railroad track where metal wheels travel at a high rate of speed like a burning metal smell.    Strange .   And to this day i never seen those 2 workers over there by the trail. But i might consider to advertise in a local paper to get in contact with them ,if there still here in albuquerque.But if i dont find them or they wouldnt want to talk,its ok .At least i know i wasnt halucinating ,they saw it too.And i want to see the objects again ,maybe to communicate .

Huge, immense,like a football field,looked round but it was so big it could have been oval because the border of the tilt make me feel it was round or oval, looked heavy, the color was clear grey metalic but it was not shiny, on the tilted side I could see, there where four roads of blinking lights, like the christmas lights. I didn't see the top because it was tilted, only the bottom and the lights around the side. After being in my car looking at this scenario, I decided to walk outside the vehicle, to see if someone else was seeing it. But when I stepped out and looked at the sky, the flying object had dissapeared. I returned to the hospital as I was so impressed... I told my story to the ER doctors I work with and everyone believe me.  I was told they see things like that all the time.  For me was the first and the last.  I called the Air Force, the TV stations, the airport, but no one give me any attention.  I do believe that I saw a UFO, I think I was fortunate to see something like that in my life.  It was too wide and too long, and absolutely quiet to be anything I have ever seen.  It was not an airplane or a flying globe.  This was a huge, immense object, so big, it couldn't be confused with any known thing.  May be a mother ship? I will never forget this experience, I could take a test to verify my story.",

I simply saw an aircraft stay in one place for about fifteen minutes, then shoot off into the sky as fast as a beam of light lights a room.  (There was a fellow there witnessing it with me at the time).  It was far away, so the best description is that it did have what seemed to be saucer shaped lighting around the bottom of the craft. As one light to my left would come on, one on the right would go off.  They were white light.  I've no idea how something stationary could instantly propel away with such a great speed.  From where we were, there was no contrail.  I was too far away to hear or not hear any noise.  There is high probability this craft was near Beale Air Force Base. The best part of this story is what happened three days later. I saw another set of lights in the sky, moving slow over the city.  This was however very very different then what I had seen before, so I decided to try to get under it.  I entered the freeway and headed in the direction of the plane until I was able to get underneath it while exiting on 34th street.  I slowed and stuck my head out to look up.  It was a crop duster with white lights in rows along the entire surface area of the bottom of the wings.  I feel this was to cover up the sighting three days earlier. This happened in Sacramento, Ca, in summer of 1999. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

I saw the lights of Las Vegas reflect off bottom [no lights on ufo at all]. As it got past the south limits of the city] about Sloan area] the object disapeared because of no more city lights reflecting off bottom.  I remember seeing the same object in an online ufo picture taken in Las Vegas in about 97'. I thought that pic was a hoax and obviously the Sanyo blimp. I realize it was the exact same thing I saw.  I've heard of the USAF flying new stealth craft over Las Vegas to test radar reflecting, but, this does not make sense. During Leonid showers more people looking at sky and this craft clearly reflected the Las Vegas city lights and thus was very visabile to anybody who happened to be looking up at 4am.

A friend and I were walking through a park behind Big Daddys Drive-In in Auburn, Wa.  We sat on a picnic table for awhile then walked back towards the direction we came on the path.  We were facing mostly East in direction.  Suddenly in the sky above there was a flash of brilliant dark blue, dark purple, then dark red.  Within that flash of changing color appeared an oval shaped small craft.  The craft had no wings and made no sound.  It was so close above us approximately 400 feet.  It sat motionless.  You could almost make out the metallic like reflections as a set of blinking lights encircled the craft.  Then, without a sound it shot some 1000 yards away from us towards the south east. Stopping instantly, then it shot into the distance and out of sight to the east.  We then stared at each other in disbelief and began to laugh at the incredibleness of it all.

Summer of 2000, no exact date recalled.  We were a small crew of contract Audio/video design/installers working at the new Brownsville Federal Courthouse.  The crew consisted of Northern Alabama, Southern West Virginia working class, slightly technical males.  I was a degreed, technically savvy programmer in charge of the crew.  I have had a lifelong interest in UFO‚Äôs but remain a skeptic of extraterrestrial explanations.   We were staying at a beachfront hotel on South Padre Island.   While having cocktails on the surf-side deck after sundown I was showing the guys how to spot orbiting satellites.  The night was clear and still.  Satellites were easy to spot as the night was young.  They were surprised it could be done with the naked eye.   Shortly one of the guys asked me if what he had spotted was a satellite.  What he had spotted was an amber light in the shape of an oval (lozenge) flying from the gulf toward land.  We were sitting facing the Gulf almost due east. I first saw it about 30¬∞ to my left (facing east) and 40¬∞ from water horizon.  The light was so clear and present I first thought it may be a streetlight reflecting off of the breast of a seagull.  The direction appeared to be slightly northwest in a straight trajectory.   As the object continued it was temporarily out of sight by other hotels as it crossed over the coastline.  The distance then seemed more apparent.  It was at least many miles away with no trail or sound or sonic boom.  The bright amber color was uniform and constant.  While the altitude seemed no more than 35¬∞ from horizon from our standpoint, it could have been at any altitude depending on the distance from us.  What makes this exceptional in my opinion is the fact that it crossed 45¬∞ of my visual in about 8 seconds at a minimum of 5 or more miles distance. It came in and was first spotted out over the Gulf of Mexico, had passed to the left of us and continued on to the back of us in 8 seconds.  Later looking at a national map and just estimating locations and observed directions, it seemed to be on a path that would have passed over Del Rio, TX.  And if continued, on toward Southern California. I guestimated the speed to be from 5,000 to 15,000 miles per hour depending on estimated distances and altitudes combined with the 8 second time interval and the 90¬∞ beginning and end of the sighting.  I personally think it was a military device.",

Working tech support in a skyscraper downtown Denver, 18th floor, looking north over Denver, Commerce City.  A sun-shining Sunday afternoon, I watched a lone, low storm cloud move southward towards the city.  As I was helping a customer fix email connectivity, I focused on watching the cloud swirls and wisps.  I noticed a shiny flicker under the cloud ceiling.   As I honed in on the shine, I clearly saw 5 oval, pill shaped crafts, stationary in a 5 dot pattern formation.  The ships would then all swing up and out, down and back in to produce a new 5 dot pattern. (I likened it to braille patterns.  I got the impression they were producing communication with the different patterns.)  They continued to display different patterns.  I quickly put my customer on hold and ran to an adjacent room where 4 of my co-workers were on calls.  I hollered with authority for all of them to put their calls on hold and hurry to my window.  All 5 of us stood at the window watching these crafts move.   I then noticed, under the southern most tip of this lone storm cloud, was a 6th craft fully stationary.  As if in a supervisory roll, or to monitor any \"dot pattern\" messages being sent to them, idk.   The storm cloud was not high in the sky, it was smaller and by itself, so lots of sun shine.  All 6 air ships had dark bottoms and shiny metallic roofs.  I figured the dark bottoms helped them stay concealed under the dark looking storm cloud.  You probably wouldn't notice them being underneath, they may not have caught your eye to make you look up.  Remember, I was on the 18th floor looking across to them.   They flew over the area of Rocky Mountain Arsenal State Park, or the Oil Refinery in Commerce City.  The was no lights, no sounds, no flares or fire or smoke.  The movements were controlled and intelligent, similar to two like magnets repelling, but controlled. After the sighting, I emailed Art Bell at Coast to Coast AM and the local NBC 9 news station, although never hearing anything back.   These ships were real, in the daylight, and very close to the Denver vicinity.",

The size had to have been longer than a football field (I know this because I could judge its length as it was really very close.  Now let me say -  it was beautiful - the colors did not seem of this earth - it was long rectangular with a very bright diamond white light in the very center - I'm only going to say \"cigar shaped\" because it was proportionate to a cigar in width and length, but its end corners were most unique - They were more perfect than a computer could draw out (how is that possible).  The material seemed to be like a silicon - it was not a metal - it was blue but darker than the sky and I say silicon material because of what the edges looked like, especially the corners - how the blue color defined itself.  It was not only too perfect of a shape for this world but the white shining light was like a diamond in its radiance, but not in its color - it was a solid white light, but not a light or sun white -like we see in any of our earth lights - not even our stars are this color white.  Also, it was not blinding, but had a magnificent radiance. I was sitting alone, but knew there was a couple about 10 yards to my side.  After about a full minute or more of me staring straight up - amazed and testing my eyes and sanity (am I awake?, here?, etc)- the craft started to move perfectly forward very slowly - as if it was a submarine (one of its ends leading).  It moved in a straight line in north-east direction.  At this time, I knew it was possibly leaving and so I moved slowly to the couple sitting close to me.  I continued to keep my eyes on the craft while I moved - nearly stumbled on the couple close by and pointed up - just saying \"Look\".  One of the people (female) looked up and said \"Oh wow!\"  At just that moment the craft started moving faster (and I mean faster) it shot north, but (bing, bing) with two angles.  Our crafts can't do that right?  long shape disappeared very soon after it shot north - The light remained very very very bright for a longh time (at least a thirty seconds or more) - until it finally got smaller and smaller and disappeared. Only one person who I went to - to look up -actually saw the long body of the craft, the other person looked up too late and only saw the white light as it bing binged away into the northern sky.  The person who saw the craft with me acted very calm - thought it was amazing, but said she had many amazing experience of the sort. She started saying,  \"Have you seen...I've seen....\".  I had never seen anything that was so clear, and so not of this world. I went inside and drew it immediately.  Even if I had not drawn exactly what I saw - my memory is crystal clear.  And the other witness, I am only happy for her that never in my mind will I ever question if it was an illusion of some sort.  It was very material, and very visible.  It never made one sound and it did not leave a trail. I am writing you to ask you if you have any photographs or video of what I saw.  I can not find anything on internet - except distant videos and photos of long rod shaped craft things - but with no light in the middle and they don't look as large as what I saw.  I have been looking.  I want to have a real picture of this magnificent craft.  I want to show my husband -whose been hearing about it for years and has seen my drawing - I want to show him a photo if you have one.  I'm thinking that I can not have been the only person who has seen this craft - it was not small - and it was still light in the skies.  I heard on coast to coast - that - in the same month/year - in the state of Washington also - \"balls of light\" were seen.  The short descriptions I heard were that the balls of light were small though. I will email you a jpeg photo of my drawing. Thank you.  Also - I heard you on Coast to Coast a few nights ago - tried to call in and tell you of my craft.  Your advice to all of us listening was to file a report on your website - so here it is.

All of a sudden I felt some sort of magnitism drawing my attention. I looked up in the sky and saw a oval shaped object sitting still in the sky. It was beautiful,it looked like an eferdescent opal color. It had a bright neon purple tail that went all the way to the ground. For some reason I pulled my car off to the side of the road and I locked my car and suddenly I was inside the object. the inside was a clean,sterile,cool room made of stainless steel. It had cabinets on the wall and it looked immaculate. There were two beings. they had big white heads and black eyes. They were actually tall and were both male and had on long white lab coats. I remember I was laying on a stainles steel table and they were examining my body. They took body fluids,blood,urine,saliva among other things. The next thing I really remember is walking back to my car with a splitting headache. I looked at the clock and it said 8:30pm  my daughter had left several messages checking on me. When I arrived at the restaurant I was still shaken and felt weak. I didnt want to say what had happened to me. but I wanted to know what had really happened. I saw one of the area firefighers and I ask him if anything had been reported in the sky. He said no. I called the sheriffs dept and kep getting the same answers..nothing unusual had been reported.  When i got up the next morning I went to my neighbors house and before I could tell her what happened she told me she had seen a flying saucer and it scared her really bad.  She described it to a t. The lady is now deceased. Many people heard the story and I had reported it on the internet somewhere the next couple of days. This was truly a real true and non fictional happening.",

   "text":"Small creatures from the sky At about 2:45am I awoke, it was cold and a steady dripping rain was occurring. I went into my pick-up and started it to warm my cold bones. There were only two other campsites in use since it was the 'early' season. One site had a few young folks and was noisy till 11pm. When I woke the sky was cloud covered, dark, and the storms had died down but the staedy rain had not. I left my tent and went into my pick-up, started the engine to warm-up, and lit a cig. Now after my 1974 UFO incident; and all the \"Talk\" after that one this was unique. All of a sudden a stream of Universal Pictures Stars decended from the low clouds. They shot straight down out of the clouds, fromed a circle, just like in the movie intro, and then spread out. There were about 15 little stars flying down, they seemed to hit the water and spread out to the west. These small lights flew at about 200mph when they came close to the water, never touched it, and spread out on the west side of the Sawmill Lake. I have been camping here at that time 30yrs. and never saw anything like this! These little lites streamed through the trees like firflies. But at 200mph! 4 of them stopped at what I knew to be an abandoned trail, the others were still flying through the campsites. One of the lites left the area on the far but close side of the lake and flew through the woods towards me. I lost track of the rest, this one was coming right for me. It landed on my windshield! I have drawn a picture, and it is not a UFO, but a small creature. The one that left the fold of 4 flew through the woods towards me; and landed on my windshield. It almost looked like a grasshopper. It had the same oval dark eyes; suchtion-cup finger tips, and was about 5\"tall. I spoke to it mentally... I Thought i Had died and they were there for me...NO! It flew away, wings and all, rejoined the other lights at the center of the lake and flew straight, with his/her friends; straight UP from where they came. This was not a UFO, but some kind of close encounter...s! o has an yone reported something like this? Aliens not in a ship? Aliens just here in some sort of glowing gold bubble? with wings, feet, hands, etc.etc. WOW Someone help me here.... my 2nd; and VERY different CE3rdK. Theses small creatures were most certianly Alien but not what you might expect. Free flying, free falling, and it seemed, free-thinking!

The only way I can describe it is a HUGH sheet of the whitest white i've every seen. Lasted about 15 seconds, if that. My vision was very blurred and I couldn't adjust to the night. I was really freaked and my dogs were clearly spooked cause they took off running and barking. I stayed in my car for about 10 minutes not wanting to get out.

   "text":"Silent oval/circular/disc semi-transpernt hovering object. On the day of Sunday, October 20th, 2002, @ 5:31pm EDT in Manassas, VA, (about 35 miles WSW of Washington, DC), when  I saw what appeared to be a balloon in the eastern sky heading over the trees to the SW.  My 22 month old son can be heard in the background.  I used my Sony 360X to record this 30 second clip.  I also had the film stopped (later) at .07 second intervals and will send some of those still shots. One of the interesting things about the timing of the event is that it was during time the snipers were running around the greater DC area, shooting people at random, including a shooting in Manassas, only a few days earlier.  Also, this was on the heels of the 2001 attacks on the Pentagon so for two autumns in a row people were on edge and were hunkering down.  Hardly anyone was out and about and I was flabbergasted as to why someone would throw a birthday party (where I thought the \"balloon\" was coming from) knowing that they (the snipers) were targeting children as well.  After forgetting about this for nearly a decade, I dug out my HI-8 take from this time frame and decided to take a second look. I looked back and the weather for that day and temperatures were in the 60s with a light wind and  it didn‚Äôt look like any atmospheric phenomena or temperature inversions were in the area.  It was completely silent and I lost it behind the trees.  If you slow the film down, it looks like a football inside a gyroscope trying to right itself for a possible take off.  To me, it looked/acted like a plasma.  If you see some of the files in succession, the leaves on the trees are effected as if there were some kind of ionizing radiation or magnetic field was being given off. As I mentioned in a previous report, I worked on NASA contracts and possess a BA in Physics with a Graduate Certificate in Space Operation. I currently teach Physics in another state (my family and I were living in Virginia at the time).",

   "text":"Bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson I saw two large bright glowing lights flying either in the clouds or just above the clouds.  Kind of off white color, maybe slightly yellowish.  Shape of both lights was mostly circular, but slightly oval.  They flew in an absolutely straight line, very fast for their size, no sound, and maintained an exact distance from each other.  I couldn't tell if it was two aircraft or one aircraft with two lights, but in either case, it had to be absolutely HUGE.  Each light was about the size of a dime if I put my arm out straight and held a dime in my fingers.  They came from the south and were heading in a north or slightly northwest direction.  Took less than 10 seconds for them to streak across the sky and out of sight. The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6.  I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start.  I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early.  When I saw the lights go by, I froze, didn't want to blink or even breath.  The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw anything like this.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone else saw it, but no one was around.  That in itself was odd.  There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time. When lunchtime came, I went back to my unit to report it to the SOC desk.  I asked them to call the tower or base ops to see if they saw it or got any similar reports.  The guy at the SOC desk just laughed and made a joke of it, like \"ha ha, Sgt E saw a UFO, what were you drinking, what were you smoking, can I have some of that too?\"  I kind of expected that since he was an assclown so I let him joke around for a minute and then I asked him, ok can we get serious now?  Just call the tower and ask them if they saw it.  Next he just ignored me so I pressed him a little harder.  Then one of the ADOs came out of his office and told me to just drop it, asked me if I have somewhere I need to be and told me to get going. I've never seen anything like it since but if I ever do, I'll certainly never report it through Air Force channels since no one wants to hear about it anyway.  There's simply no one who takes such reports.  Report it through your chain of command and they won't give a crap.  Report it to any other Air Force agency and it will never make it past the nearest shredder or trash can.  The \"that's not my job\" philosophy definitely applies here. Since I just found this site and a couple others like it, I figured I'd check to see if anyone else ever saw what I saw, but I don't see any that match this particular sighting.  So for what it's worth, here's my one and only sighting.  If I see any more, I'll let you know.",

   "text":"I have an entire armada of different type crafts appear in a short time and it is almost overwhelming! Tonight has been a most unusual night, since the Geminid began there has been many strange objects of \"starlike\" shape, these star shapes are silver and gold with flashing lights of green, blue and red, for each silver object a gold one is positioned beside it at an equal distance, there are 40 or more of these and as said these have been in the sky since the evening of 12/13/02 and appeared to use \"meteor's\" to seed clouds which they then engulfed.   As of last evening they did not make or abosorb any more clouds, all have been stationary with the exception of 2 of which 1 chased an airplane a few nights ago and last night a gold one raced across the sky and became almost cigar shaped.   Tonight the skys are very cloudy with heavy winds, the waether where I live is strange as few rain storms ever come over because they break and split apart prior, the clouds look like they are pouring into a hole at a place a mile or so away{this is the origination of a strange sighting last Sept}, many funnel clouds have formed and made way to this place, being funnel clouds are very common due to the weather pattern they got noticed tonight for pointing downward when usually they just roll across the sky.  Where they form is to the S-SW and were formed as they usually do across the sky but when approaching the convergence of the Westerly& Southerly winds{cause of weather pattern} the funnels pointed downward, when they reached the converging point an oval light would jet down toward the ground, this happened several times so I began retracing from N-S and was amazed to see these ovals hiding themselves in the funnels near where most of them form, when a funnel appeared to be dispersing the oval would come to the end of the tube/funnel and wait for small dark clouds to get near and then would hide behind them, I saw at least 50 do this, they are about the size of a gymnasium maybe even larger. Once I got an idea of what is happening I began to notice the clouds they hide behind if losing their funnel had distinct shapes, ! I was al most unsure if I could stand it all, some clouds had the shape of a flying V and bigger than the ovals and others triangular and yet some were chevron shaped, I saw 20+ of these. When I began looking thru my binoculars I could see ver faint red/range blue and green dots covring the chevron shaped objects and last Sept. there were hundreds of the red/orange going into the sky, up then as if dancing then across the horizon with equal distance between, they appeared to be the same or similar dots, as well last Sept. the red dots appeared to be fighting with something to resemble a red dragon almost like a phoenix but not quite, the battle happened almost overhead but at once the stars seemingly exploded{may have been the \"starlike\" objects here now but I was'nt paying that much attention then} after a heavy fog covered most of the sky but left open the place from where they came from the ground, after 9/11/01 and this madness going on we contacted the Sheriffs Dept who responded with 4 deputies, most of the red balls were gone but 2 graciously appeared above a dead pine just as the deputies were writing me off as a \"Knut\", they had little to say about and I jokingly stated it probably to be \"Swamp Gas\" then they left, several nights later an octagonal craft came from the south going north{the UFO hole}, it had faint blacklights surrounding the edge but were on the underside, had 2 big lights across the face which resemble a ZZTop album cover and a rectangular set of red lights that would flash differently as if it were some type of communication, this craft is able to hover and move horizontal at great speeds, if I focused my binoculars a bit off te starlike objects could well be similar but the stars would have been made of several of these hex ones, I have several witnesses for each account !!! Back to tonights show, as well as the starlike, the red/orange dots, the chevron, triangular and Vshapes there were smaller ovals but they had a more oblong appearence. The small ovals did not use funnels but seemed to hold white clouds together and move from south to north as did the others, these would sometimes be in small groups of 4 or 5 in the same cloud, they moved on the clouds bottomside and disappeared as did the others. Where the sky breaks the incoming storms approximately 2 miles south I would see a flicker now and then but with all the excitement it took a while to give them much attention, once I focused on them I saw small green, blue and red semi-cigar shapes that would scramble behind the clouds anytime a clear spot appeared, there were too many small dot and semi-cigar shapes to try to count. As of now the event is still happening and while peering out my sliding glass doors a gigantic rounded hexagonal shape with a bulging circle in the center just came over using a dark cloud for concealment. I have an idea that I may be near a centralized location for some sort of being that is capable of technology beyond ours, that uses things from the atmosphere for an unknown purpose, is very diverse and that lives under ground as a large society of sorts as well as occasionally emerging and re-entering for the reason of stockpiling whatever it is they take from the atmosphere/clouds. Apparently they are peaceful enough because I have had nor heard of any encounters with them other than sightings. I also believe I may be in way over my head in trying to unvail any more information alone, where would one begin to look for help ??? I am going to close now and continue observing and will gladly inform you all of anymore findings !",

It flew in a straight line and could not have been a light shining on the clouds as it was completely cloudless at the time and there was no beam of light going up to it.  The object was of a crescent shape and flew with the concave side forward.  It emitted a white light which was steady and unchanging, somewhat clear throughout but a bit fuzzy at the edges.   As I saw the object, it covered about 1/4 of the sky in about 5 seconds and appeared to be flying somewhat lower than the cruising altitude of a jetliner.   I don't know if anyone else saw it and I did not notice any media coverage.

I was with my son's two male friends . We were all waiting for my son and girlfriend to finished their last ride. Park closes at 10:00pm  The time was about 9:55pm  I looked up to the southwest and witnessed this truly bizarre  ' thing ' in the sky. From behind me and overhead heading southwest over the township of Vaughan,Ontario. Somewhere from 5- 10 thousand feet in altitude. Clear sky - hot evening  This brilliant white cigar shaped object -jump across the sky. Just like a tic jumping - point to point in vast distance  It covered in only 5- 7 seconds as witnessed  At least the distance of somewhere between 5- 10 miles across. This brilliant white torpedo shape craft. Had rotating green and red lights underneath the front and back. Not in the mid section or body. After it had passed by and instantly pointed out to the two young witnesses. One asked &quot; was that a blimp we just saw &quot;. I said no - it was a UFO. He then said I'm getting afraid !  The other witness said &quot; I'm getting excited &quot; !  After about three minutes after the event. My son and girlfriend came out from the ride. I asked both of them if they saw a strange white object in the sky. My son did not see it. Though his girlfriend asked him while on the ride. Hey what's that a blimp !  Three witnesses besides myself. Had indeed witnessed some type of futuristic shuttle craft. To witness the speed and behaviour of the movement - incredible  Totally non - human in nature.",

   "text":"Dark stationary craft - hovering at about 1000 feet Attn: Peter Davenport  Subject: UFO  Sighting Area: Village of Oak Creek (VOC), Sedona AZ   Dear Peter, (being I am 72-years of age I will address you as Peter instead of Mr. Davenport.)   This sighting took place in 2003 (the exact day is unknown but I believe it was on August 23rd).   The sighting was later verified as having been seen by two Mexican laborers I had working on my property. As you can see by the attached photos (jpegs) of which there are two (2) the sighting was photographed with an old digital camera close by the edge of a street in VOC and shows the same landscape with about a 10-feet difference.  I am sending you four jpegs of the sighting of which two are enlargements of the object in question. For your information, although I would prefer anonymity regarding what I am sending you, my wife and I are known artists, although 30 some years in the past I was, for 14-years, a trained US Army Special Forces NCO and worked in intelligence and communications under the command and control of the CIA.  The reason for my telling you this is that if there is an investigation it will not leave you hanging for a response.  Also, there is the fact that since 2000 I have video-taped a number of unidentified flying objects in and nearby VOC; but enough of the past as this sighting was accidental as at the time my wife was photographing monsoon clouds to use in her paintings and we did not see the object until the photographs were downloaded onto our computer. Even then the object was thought to have been a speck of dirt or other material on the lens.  It wasn‚Äôt until I began enlarging the photographs that I sighted; on the bottom left of the photo a red spot lighted area upon the ground and above, on the top left, a white spot lighted area on a cloud.  Reflected sunlight?  However, photo nr. two shows, on the bottom left, only a white spotlighted area on the ground.  Further enlargements of the black spot (see corresponding formation of sky surrounding the unknown object) piqued my curiosity when it showed an oval object that looks to be a person in side the object, standing before a vertical rectangular object (control board?).  I will leave it up to you as to what the object is and, if you find it intriguing, enlarge the object yourself. As for the Mexican laborers, they told me they had sighted the same object while changing a flat tire on their vehicle.  They also stated that the object had then approached and landed upon one of the Mesas in the background shown in my photos.  When they returned home and told their families they had been ridiculed so they hadn‚Äôt told anyone else other than their employer.  Later, while working upon a studio for me I showed the photos to their employer and he then showed it to the two men and they told me that the object was the same one they had sighted.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have the two men write down what they had seen and like the unknown day we took the photos I or my wife cannot provide any further information.",

The object was luminous, a mauve or orange-red color. We each had a different opinion of the exact color. It seemed to be oval, but had 3 lights evenly spaced, like a triange, on the bottom. It made no noise. It flew from north to south as I saw it (I didn't look at it until it disappeared). It followed the main north/south road in town (Broadway). One of my friends said she initially thought it was a something falling from the sky, like a person, but as she looked at it she saw what the rest of us did. She also saw this thing suddenly go east when it hit the horizon (I had looked away by that point). I hate to call this thing a UFO because I still don't know if I believe in that.  It's just that I have no explaination. I have seen in the past where geese would fly over during the night and you can see the reflection of the city lights on their bellies. It wasn't that. Too high and they definately aren't quiet. It wasn't an airplane from the International airport. It was too high and it wasn't a plane. There is an Air Force Base about 10 miles to the north of the city. It has mainly B52's and missles. That didn't make sense either. I tried to ask one of my friends about it a few weeks later, and she said she wouldn't talk about it. I wrote an entry in my diary that night. I've hardly spoken of the incident, and have never reported it before this. I guess I don't even believe myself.",
